# ClearGov
Work with the University of Alberta to enable more transparent governance. The University's governing bodies meet in GFC Commitiees (see project glossary) who debate on issues affecting topics such as tuition and program availability. The minutes of these meetings are available to the public, but there is no available way to search and categorize them for research or study. This project seeks to provide a search and visualizations tool for the public to use.

# Development
## Branches
This project uses a branching pattern as follows:
* Branches are created to work on features, issues, or optimizations
* Pull requests are issued to the 'dev' branch, which are then automatically tested by Travis CI (which includes tests that we write)
* When the 'dev' branch is at a releasable stage, it will be pushed to the 'master' branch

Therefore you may pull master and it should work on your system if you have the right prerequisites.

## Project Boards
The project is divided into 4 Sprints, each Sprint has a project board here on github and you may view them to see what issues we are working on at any given time.
