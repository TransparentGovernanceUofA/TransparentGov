Presenter(s): Deborah Burshtyn, Associate Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research (FGSR); Jeffrey 
Johnson, Associate Dean, Education, School of Public Health; Ruth Wolf, Practicum Program Director, School 
of Public Health 
 
Purpose of the Proposal:  The proposed calendar changes represent a restructuring of the core curricula across 
all  seven  of  our  current  MPH  degree  programs.  This  involves  a  replacement  of  the  current  common  core 
courses  required  for  all  MPH  degree  programs  with  a  set  of  newly  developed  common  core  courses,  and 
consequent revision of specialization requirements.  
 
Discussion: 
Dr  Burshtyn  noted  that  this  proposal  represents  an  overhaul  for  the  program  requirements  for  second  level 
specializations in the Master of Public Health and that it is structured around outcomes and competencies.  She 
also noted that this is a good example of how  
 
Dr  Johnson  noted  that  the  redesign  allows  for  a  common  core  curriculum  for  all  of  the  second  level 
specializations that integrates these specializations and provides more interdisciplinary training.  The program 
aims to prepare public health practitioners for a clinical environment. Dr Wolfe confirmed that equity and social 
justice are core values in public health and that Aboriginal health and marginal populations would be included in 
the courses.  
 
During the discussion, the importance of indigenous health was acknowledged and was being integrated into the 
core courses currently in development. 
 
Members expressed additional questions in relation to fees, terms, and the removal of certain courses in the 
redesign. It was also noted that the proposal represents a good example of program design. 
 
Motion:  Acker/Campbell 
 
THAT  the  GFC  Academic  Planning  Committee  approve,  under  delegated  authority  from  General  Faculties 
Council, the proposal for revisions to the curriculum of the Master of Public Health (MPH) in the School of Public 
Health as proposed by the Faculty of Graduate Studies & Research, and as set forth in Attachment 1, to be 
effective for admissions to Fall 2018.

Proposal for Substantive Changes to the Undergraduate Nursing Curriculum, Faculty of Nursing  

 
5. 
 
Materials before members are contained in the official meeting file. 
 
Presenter(s): Greta Cummings, Dean, Faculty of Nursing; Olive Yonge, Vice-Dean; Faculty of Nursing; Sandra 
Davidson, Associate Dean (Undergraduate Programs), Faculty of Nursing 
 
Purpose of the Proposal: To discuss and approve substantive changes to the Undergraduate Nursing program, 
the  proposed  transition  plans  (cross-walks),  and  the  associated  admissions and  academic  standing  calendar 
changes for these program changes. 
 
Discussion: 
Dean  Cummings  reported  that  this  proposal  represents  two  years  of  planning  and  extensive  development 
culminating in over one hundred recommendations for the new curriculum. 
 
Dr Davidson provided an overview to the committee noting that the changes are student-focused and meet the 
Canadian  Association  of  Schools  of  Nursing  (CASN)  accreditation  standards  and  comply  with  competencies

required by the College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta (CARNA).  Dr Davidson explained that 
the new program aims to develop nurse leaders who can facilitate change in a clinical setting. 
 
Dr Yonge explained that a cross-walk program has been developed for students who entered the program in the 
fall of 2017 which will allow them to move into year two of the new programs in the fall of 2018. 
 
Members, during the discussion, commended the presenters for their inclusion of indigenous health. 
 
Members sought clarification regarding the length of the program, the changes to academic performance, and a 
member suggested an editorial amendment to the calendar wording in the proposal. 
 
Motion:  Glanfield/Hamilton 
 
THAT  the  GFC  Academic  Planning  Committee  approve,  with  delegated  authority  from  General  Faculties 
Council, proposed changes to the Undergraduate Nursing Curriculum, as proposed by the Faculty of Nursing, 
and as set forth in Attachment 1, to take effect Fall 2018.

Learning Moment: Program Budgets contained in Academic Program Proposals  

 
DISCUSSION ITEMS 
 
6. 
 
Materials before members are contained in the official meeting file. 
 
Presenter(s): Chad Schulz, Director, Integrated Finance Services; Edith Finczak, Director, Academic Budget & 
Planning; Tammy Hopper, Vice-Provost (Programs) 
 
Purpose of the Proposal: To brief the GFC Academic Planning Committee on how program budgets are being 
drafted to satisfy the requirements of the Ministry of Advanced Education for proposed degree, certificate and 
diploma programs. 
 
Discussion: 
Dr Hopper reported that the Ministry of Advanced Education has revised their program templates to include a 
detailed  budget  section  and  is  requesting more  information  about  program-level  budgets. She noted that  the 
Provost Office is working with units to develop this information as the university does not allocate funding or 
track expenditure at the program level. Ms Finczak reviewed the methodology utilized to develop program-level 
budgets and the assumptions made. 
 
Members discussed direct and indirect costs, the challenges in allocating faculty time to a specific program, how 
to distinguish research and teaching activities, and service teaching. A member stated that this data should not 
be used as hard evidence of revenues and costs. 
 
The Chair clarified that this formula is not being used to make internal institutional budget decisions and that 
government reviews this information through a program lens as opposed to a departmental one.

Proposed Changes to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) Terms of Reference  

GFC Academic Planning Committee 10/25/2017 
Page 4 

 
Purpose of the Proposal: To discuss amendments to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) terms of 
reference. 
 
Discussion: 
The Chair led members through the current committee terms of reference. A member suggested that the Deputy 
Provost should be added as a non-voting member. While it was noted that the Deputy Provost can attend as the 
Provost’s delegate, there was general agreement by the committee that the Deputy Provost could be a non-
voting member.  
 
It  was  noted  that  information  technology  was  missing  from  governance,  even  though  IT  impacts  research, 
teaching  and  other  scholarly  activities.    The  Chair  indicated  that  there  are  administrative  committees  that 
discuss IT governance and that further clarity on this item would be developed and brought back to members for 
further discussion. 
 
During  the  discussion  on  the  proposed  move  of  college  programming  from  APC  to  the  GFC  Academic 
Standards  Committee  (ASC),  it  was  noted  that  more  consultation  with  the  Dean  of  Faculté  Saint-Jean  was 
needed. 
 
During  the  discussion,  members  enquired  about  the  role  of  the  member  appointed  by  Chairs’  Council,  the 
difference between administrative committees and governance committees, APC’s role in quality assurance, the 
term “school”, and the manner in which fees and new fees are routed through governance.  
 
The Chair reported that this item would be included on future agendas for further discussion. 
 
8.  Update on the Budget  
 
There were no documents. 
 
Presenter(s): Steven Dew, Chair, and Provost and Vice-President (Academic) 
 
Purpose of the Proposal:  For information/discussion. 
 
Discussion: 
The Chair reported on the recent announcement of an anticipated 4% reduction in base budget allocations for 
2018-19 followed by projected 2.5% reductions for both 2019-20 and 2020-21.  This is based on assumptions of 
no increase to the Campus Alberta Grant or tuition.  Members discussed specific program cuts rather than 
across-the-board cuts as well as the impacts of this on Faculties. 
 
The Chair noted the current structural deficit, previous reliance on investment income for base funds, and cost 
challenges related to external contracts, minimum wage changes, and exchange rates. He also discussed the 
planning framework, the budget model, and multi-year forecasting. The Chair noted that there would be a town 
hall on the planning framework on November 9 and that there would be further discussion on this item at the 
November 8 meeting of APC.
