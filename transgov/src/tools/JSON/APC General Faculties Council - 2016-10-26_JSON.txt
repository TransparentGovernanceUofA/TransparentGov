Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. The Alberta Human Rights Act: defines 13 grounds for protection of rights in five areas including employment practices, applications and ads (Preamble; Section 3(1)):  “WHEREAS it is recognized in Alberta as a fundamental principle and as a matter of public policy that all persons are equal in: dignity, rights and responsibilities without regard to race, religious beliefs, colour, gender, gender identity, gender expression, physical disability, mental disability, age, ancestry, place of origin, marital status, source of income, family status or sexual orientation;  Discrimination re publications, notices 3(1)  No person shall publish, issue or display or cause to be published, issued or displayed before the public any statement, publication, notice, sign, symbol, emblem or other representation that (a)    indicates discrimination or an intention to discriminate against a person or a class of persons, or (b)    is likely to expose a person or a class of persons to hatred or contempt because of the race, religious beliefs, colour, gender, gender identity, gender expression, physical disability, mental disability, age, ancestry, place of origin, marital status, source of income, family status or sexual orientation of that person or class of persons. 2. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment (Sections 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic Standards Committee (GFC ASC). 3. GFC Academic Standards Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate)  “The ASC is responsible for making recommendations and/or for providing advice to GFC, its Executive Committee, and/or the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) on the matters set out below, which include such areas as admissions and transfer, including admission and transfer to Faculties, admission of Open Studies students, academic standing policies and general university admission policies, and all institutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures.” […] “B.

ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these proposals. (GFC 29 SEP 2003) (GFC 31 MAY 2005) (EXEC 04 DEC 2006)  […]  v. ASC provides advice or recommends to APC on general University admission or transfer policies affecting students, including policies which affect Open Studies.” 4. GFC Academic Planning Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate) “7. Admission, Transfer and Academic Standing a. To consider advice or recommendation from the GFC ASC on proposals for the establishment of or change to general University admission or transfer policies affecting students, including policies affecting Open Studies students, and to act for GFC in approving policies which in APC’s view are minor or routine; and to recommend to GFC on proposals involving major change.” 5. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference  “5. Agendas of General Faculties Council  GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those agenda items appear on each GFC agenda. […]  When recommendations are forwarded to General Faculties Council from APC, the role of the Executive shall be to decide the order in which items should be considered by GFC. The Executive Committee is responsible for providing general advice to the Chair about proposals being forwarded from APC to GFC.” 6. UAPPOL Admissions Policy Those responsible for admissions decisions will interpret and apply the established admission requirements and regulations, in a transparent process, in order to admit the best-qualified applicants from the total number of applicants who are eligible for admission, in accordance with Faculty enrolment targets or program quotas. The basis on which a student is admitted, and any academic provisions of admission, will not diminish or eliminate that student's rights and responsibilities, as detailed in the University Calendar.

The Impact of the Proposal is The University Equity Statement is used on all academic and support staff job postings as outlined in the UAPPOL Procedures for Academic Staff Posting and Advertising and Support Staff Posting and Advertising. The statement would reflect the language commonly used in employment equity statements and includes the addition of gender expression and gender identity which are now protected grounds in legislation. References to designated groups identified in the Employment Equity Act have been removed as the groups identified are now broader and align with Alberta Human Rights legislation. The proposed changes align with the Statement on Equity in Student Affairs in the University Calendar.

This authority has not been reflected in the documents to date; at this time, the proposal seeks to have this confirmed. In addition, the changes to the Equity Statement which align with current legislative requirements, are also an important statement of the University’s position and practice in this area. Work is currently being conducted to develop a more overarching University statement.

Implementation of changes in 2018-2019 Calendar. Supplementary Notes and context The Department of Biological Sciences is proposing a departmental-wide consolidation of programs which will reduce the current number of honors/specialization programs from seven to three. The proposals  includes the suspension of four programs (Animal Biology, Evolutionary Biology, Microbiology, and Plant Biology) and the renaming of three programs. At the October 20, 2016 meeting, the GFC Academic Standards Committee, with delegated authority from GFC, approved by a majority vote the suspension of admission to these programs.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA).  “26(1) Subject to the authority of the board, a general faculties council is responsible for the academic affairs of the university” 2. PSLA Section 29(1) “A faculty council may  (a) determine the programs of study for which the faculty is established [ ] (c) provide for the admission of students to the faculty [ ] (e) authorize the granting of degrees, subject to any conditions or restrictions that are imposed by the general faculties council.” 3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.)  The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine. The responsibility for admission decisions for Open Studies will be vested in the Office of the Registrar.  Those responsible for admissions decisions will interpret and apply the established admission requirements and regulations, in a transparent process, in order to admit the best-qualified applicants from the total number of applicants who are eligible for admission, in accordance with Faculty enrolment targets or program quotas. The basis on which a student is admitted, and any academic provisions of admission, will not diminish or eliminate that student's rights and responsibilities, as detailed  in the University Calendar.” 4.
