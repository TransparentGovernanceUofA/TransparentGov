The tool also creates an electronic database of course information that can be used by faculties to run various types of curriculum mapping reports. The demonstration is meant to gauge interest from Faculties to begin to use the tool to manage syllabi creation and perform mapping.  Support for further development will be discussed. Timeline/Implementation Date N/A Supplementary Notes and context Engagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) Participation: (parties who have seen the proposal and in what capacity) Those who have been informed: • Sarah Forgie (VP Learning Initiatives) and Mike MacGregor (VP Information Services Technology) were informed of the progress and general interest in the tool from various faculties. Those who have been consulted: • Norma Nocente, Associate Director Educational Technology, CTL was provided a demonstration of the tool and recommended that it be shown to the CLE for information. Those who are actively participating: • Jeff Rawlings Director, Relationship Management IST and the moodle development team are actively supporting a contracted moodle programmer to develop the tool Alignment/Compliance Alignment with Guiding Documents For the Public Good The information aligns with the Institutional Strategic Plan - For the Public Good 14.i-v and has the potential to enhance monitoring and evaluation of curriculum across the university. EXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service. Objective 14: Inspire, model, and support excellence in teaching and learning. Strategy i: Foster, encourage, and support innovation and experimentation in curriculum development, teaching, and learning at the individual, unit, and institutional levels. Strategy ii: Adopt a set of core graduate attributes, skills, and competencies at both the undergraduate and graduate level; develop strategies for implementing them in specific disciplines and programs; and monitor graduate outcomes to ensure continuous improvement. Strategy iii: Provide robust supports, tools, and training to develop and assess teaching quality, using qualitative and quantitative criteria that are fair, equitable, and meaningful across disciplines. Strategy iv:  Create and support an institutional strategy that enables excellence in the design, deployment, and assessment of digital learning technologies.

GFC CLE established the subcommittee on March 2, 2016 to explore the opportunities and barriers to creating a teaching tenure stream at University of Alberta. It was charged with preparing a report summarizing its discussions, review of existing evidence and its likely consequences (excluding financial implications) for teaching and learning environment at the institution. The attached White Paper focuses on reviewing existing evidence and its likely consequences for teaching and learning environment at the institution.  Further to the discussion on Nov 2, 2016 at CLE, the White Paper also includes a comparison of information on teaching stream at eight other Canadian institutions based on publicly available information (mostly institutional policies, collective bargaining agreements, data reported in institutional planning and analysis, and in rare cases media communication). These institutions represent a cross-section of Canadian post-secondary institutions of different size, research ability, and membership in U15 and are spread across Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Nova Scotia).
