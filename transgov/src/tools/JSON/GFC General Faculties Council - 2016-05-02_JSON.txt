To engage GFC in a discussion on the terms of reference of GFC with particular attention to “3. Mandate of the Committee”. GFC will be asked to consider: • Are we living up to the principles of the Mandate? • What is the desired level of clarity on delegated authority? • Is current practice matching the Mandate? • Are we striking a correct balance between full delegation and no delegation? • Are appropriate matters being referred to full GFC from standing committee? • Is this your vision of Academic Governance?  The Impact of the Proposal is Following the discussion at the March 21 meeting, an additional meeting was scheduled for May 2 to accommodate further discussion of this issue. The discussion will provide the working group, and the GFC Executive Committee, with guidance to prepare a recommendation for GFC on standing committee delegations for the May 30, 2016 meeting. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) N/A Timeline/Implementation Date Recommendation to GFC on standing committee delegations - May 30, 2016 Estimated Cost N/A Sources of Funding N/A Notes On January 25, 2016, General Faculties Council approved the following motions: Motion I:  THAT General Faculties Council will review the delegation of its authorities to all of its current committee, and by 30 June 2016 vote on whether to renew or revise these delegated authorities.

When ordering items, the GFC Executive Committee will be mindful of any matters that are of particular concern to students during March and April so that the student leaders who bring those items forward are able to address these items at GFC before their terms end. (EXEC 06 NOV 2006)  […] With respect to recommendations from other bodies and other GFC committees, however, the role of the Executive Committee shall be to examine and debate the substance of reports or recommendations and to decide if an item is ready to be forwarded to the full governing body. The Executive Committee may decide to refer a proposal back to the originating body, to refer the proposal to another body or individual for study or review, or to take other action in order to ready a proposal for consideration by General Faculties Council. When the GFC Executive Committee forwards a proposal to GFC, it shall make a recommendation that GFC endorse; endorse with suggested amendments; not endorse; or forward the proposal with no comment.” Routing (Include meeting dates) Participation: (parties who have seen the proposal and in what capacity) GFC Executive Committee (for discussion) – December 7, 2015 and January 11, 2016 General Faculties Council (for discussion) – January 25, 2016 GFC Executive Committee (for discussion) – February 1 and March 7, 2016 GFC Executive Committee Working Group  on Academic Governance (for discussion)– February/March 2016 General Faculties Council (for discussion) – March 21, 2016 Academic Governance Working Group (for discussion) – April 2016 GFC Executive Committee (for discussion) – April 11, 2016 General Faculties Council – May 2, 2016 Approval Route (Governance) (including meeting dates) Final Approver  Attachments: Attachment 1 (pages 1-6): Excerpt from the Post-Secondary Learning Act, sections 26 and 31.
