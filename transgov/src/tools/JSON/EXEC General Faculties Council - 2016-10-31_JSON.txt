These values are drawn from the principles on which the University of Alberta was founded in 1908 and reflect a dynamic, modern institution of higher learning, leading change nationally and internationally.  Above all, we value intellectual integrity, freedom of inquiry and expression, and the equality and dignity of all persons as the foundation of ethical conduct in research, teaching, learning, and service.  We value excellence in teaching, research, and creative activity that enriches learning experiences, advances knowledge, inspires engaged citizenship, and promotes the public good.  We value learners at all stages of life and strive to provide an intellectually rewarding educational environment for all.  We value academic freedom and institutional autonomy as fundamental to open inquiry and the pursuit of truth.  We value diversity, inclusivity, and equity across and among our people, campuses, and disciplines.  We value creativity and innovation from the genesis of ideas through to the dissemination of knowledge.  We value the history and traditions of our university, celebrating with pride our people, achievements, and contributions to society. Strategic Goals  Goal:  EXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service. To excel and achieve our full potential as an institution and as individuals, the University of Alberta will sustain a learning and research culture that inspires, supports, and champions high professional  standards and outstanding achievements in basic and applied research and scholarship, creative activity, administration, and governance. We will ensure that learning experiences at our university are of the highest quality, based on a practice of continuous improvement and innovation in teaching. From our broad-based strength as a comprehensive, research-\nintensive public university, we will highlight current and emerging areas of global distinction and leadership by building a portfolio of signature areas that distinguish us from among our peer institutions and exemplify the University of Alberta’s capacity to engage in big questions and global challenges. Goal:  SUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by attracting and stewarding the resources we need to deliver excellence to the benefit of all Albertans. To achieve our strategic goals, the University of Alberta will attract and steward the resources we need to excel and deliver our core teaching and research mission at the high standard expected by all Albertans. We will build on our capacities for securing new sources of operating, capital, research, and philanthropic funding. We will continue to model and advance teaching and learning in the area of environmental sustainability on our campuses and in our work. We must sustain our people by promoting health, wellness, and safety as a defining feature of the University of Alberta’s learning and working experience, and by maintaining and enhancing the university’s essential teaching, learning, and research infrastructure. Continuous improvement and cross-unit engagement and co-operation will define our approach to governance and administration to ensure that our systems, policies, and procedures facilitate the achievement of our shared goals. Objective 21:  Encourage continuous improvement in administrative, governance, planning and stewardship systems, procedures, and policies that enable students, faculty, staff, and the institutions as a whole to achieve shared strategic goals. Strategy i: Encourage transparency and improve communication across the university through clear consultation and decision-making processes, substantive and timely communication of information, and access to shared, reliable institutional data.  Strategy ii: Ensure that individual and institutional annual review processes align with and support key institutional strategic goals.  Strategy iii: Consolidate unit review and strategic planning processes, and where possible, align with accreditation processes, to ensure efficient assessment practices.  Strategy iv: Facilitate easy access to and use of university services and systems; reduce duplication and complexity; and encourage cross-\ninstitutional administrative and operational collaboration.  Strategy v: Develop a set of equitable, meaningful, and relevant measures to monitor our progress toward strategic goals and develop  the tools required to report on them.

Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. The Alberta Human Rights Act: defines 13 grounds for protection of rights in five areas including employment practices, applications and ads (Preamble; Section 3(1)):  “WHEREAS it is recognized in Alberta as a fundamental principle and as a matter of public policy that all persons are equal in: dignity, rights and responsibilities without regard to race, religious beliefs, colour, gender, gender identity, gender expression, physical disability, mental disability, age, ancestry, place of origin, marital status, source of income, family status or sexual orientation;  Discrimination re publications, notices 3(1)  No person shall publish, issue or display or cause to be published, issued or displayed before the public any statement, publication, notice, sign, symbol, emblem or other representation that (a)    indicates discrimination or an intention to discriminate against a person or a class of persons, or (b)    is likely to expose a person or a class of persons to hatred or contempt because of the race, religious beliefs, colour, gender, gender identity, gender expression, physical disability, mental disability, age, ancestry, place of origin, marital status, source of income, family status or sexual orientation of that person or class of persons. 2. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment (Sections 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic Standards Committee (GFC ASC). 3. GFC Academic Standards Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate)  “The ASC is responsible for making recommendations and/or for providing advice to GFC, its Executive Committee, and/or the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) on the matters set out below, which include such areas as admissions and transfer, including admission and transfer to Faculties, admission of Open Studies students, academic standing policies and general university admission policies, and all institutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures.” […] “B.

ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these proposals. (GFC 29 SEP 2003) (GFC 31 MAY 2005) (EXEC 04 DEC 2006)  […]  v. ASC provides advice or recommends to APC on general University admission or transfer policies affecting students, including policies which affect Open Studies.” 4. GFC Academic Planning Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate) “7. Admission, Transfer and Academic Standing a. To consider advice or recommendation from the GFC ASC on proposals for the establishment of or change to general University admission or transfer policies affecting students, including policies affecting Open Studies students, and to act for GFC in approving policies which in APC’s view are minor or routine; and to recommend to GFC on proposals involving major change.” 5. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference  “5. Agendas of General Faculties Council  GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those agenda items appear on each GFC agenda. […]  When recommendations are forwarded to General Faculties Council from APC, the role of the Executive shall be to decide the order in which items should be considered by GFC. The Executive Committee is responsible for providing general advice to the Chair about proposals being forwarded from APC to GFC.” 6. UAPPOL Admissions Policy Those responsible for admissions decisions will interpret and apply the established admission requirements and regulations, in a transparent process, in order to admit the best-qualified applicants from the total number of applicants who are eligible for admission, in accordance with Faculty enrolment targets or program quotas. The basis on which a student is admitted, and any academic provisions of admission, will not diminish or eliminate that student's rights and responsibilities, as detailed in the University Calendar.

The Impact of the Proposal is The University Equity Statement is used on all academic and support staff job postings as outlined in the UAPPOL Procedures for Academic Staff Posting and Advertising and Support Staff Posting and Advertising. The statement would reflect the language commonly used in employment equity statements and includes the addition of gender expression and gender identity which are now protected grounds in legislation. References to designated groups identified in the Employment Equity Act have been removed as the groups identified are now broader and align with Alberta Human Rights legislation. The proposed changes align with the Statement on Equity in Student Affairs in the University Calendar. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Revises the defined University Equity Statement to indicate the University Employment Equity Statement in the UAPPOL Academic Staff Posting and Advertising and Support Staff Posting and Advertising.  Timeline/Implementation Date Upon approval Estimated Cost and funding source N/A Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) The University Employment Equity Statement and the University Territorial Statement will be included on the Human Resource Services website.

At that time, the Board of Governors noted that, following approval, the respective Vice-\nPresidents would manage the procedures/procedural changes within the policy without having to return to the Board of Governors for ongoing approval. This authority has not been reflected in the documents to date; at this time, the proposal seeks to have this confirmed. In addition, the changes to the Equity Statement which align with current legislative requirements, are also an important statement of the University’s position and practice in this area. Work is currently being conducted to develop a more overarching University statement.
