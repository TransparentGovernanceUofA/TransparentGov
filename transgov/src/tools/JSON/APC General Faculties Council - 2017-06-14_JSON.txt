The proposed changes are supported by research undertaken by the Office of the Registrar. The Impact of the Proposal is It is anticipated that the proposed changes will have a positive impact on student success within the international student body. Research conducted by the Enrolment Management unit in the Office of the Registrar shows the correlation between a higher overall ELP score and student success in first year courses, as indicated by final GPA and/or course withdrawals.  As a result of the proposed changes, an increased number of applicants might enter their chosen faculty/program through the Bridging program. The number of International applications may decrease which may lead to a reduction in the number of students admitted. There may also be a positive reputational impact associated with more rigorous ELP requirements.

Supplementary Notes and context On November 19, 2015, the Chair reported on the establishment of a group to look at English language proficiency and ASC had a brief discussion on current band scores and the difference in requirements for graduate and undergraduate programs.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment (Sections 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic Standards Committee (GFC ASC).  2. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference: “B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, Term Work, Examinations, International Baccalaureate (IB), Advanced Placement (AP) iv. ASC provides advice or recommends to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) on proposals which involve substantial change to admission/transfer regulations or to academic standing regulations. v. ASC provides advice or recommends to APC on general University admission or  3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. These criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.)  The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 4. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure:  “PROCEDURE EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS  Following approval by GFC:  a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006).”  b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty. 5. GFC Academic Planning Committee Terms of Reference  “7. Admission, Transfer and Academic Standing a. To consider advice or recommendation from the GFC ASC on proposals for the establishment of or change to general University admission or transfer policies affecting students, including policies affecting Open Studies students, and to act for GFC in approving policies which in APC’s view are minor or routine; and to recommend to GFC on proposals involving major change b. To consider advice or recommendation from GFC ASC on proposals which involve substantial change to admission/transfer or to academic standing regulations.” 6. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference “GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those agenda items appear on each GFC agenda. […]  When recommendations are forwarded to General Faculties Council from APC, the role of the Executive shall be to decide the order in which items should be considered by GFC. The Executive Committee is responsible for providing general advice to the Chair about proposals being forwarded from APC to GFC.” Attachments  1.
