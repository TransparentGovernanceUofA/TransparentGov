A new sustainability plan has been developed for 2016-2020 as well as a companion document to inform, academic planning. The new sustainability plan outlines areas for improving our institution’s sustainability performance and educational programming. It will be used to help guide strategic decisions across the institution, program decisions regarding outreach initiatives, operational improvements and enhancements to academic programs. Timeline/Implementation Date 2016-2020 Supplementary Notes and context Background: Sustainability is increasingly at the forefront of agendas for local, provincial and national governments, as well as higher education. In 2008, the Board of Governors endorsed the institution’s sustainability commitment and guiding principles, the creation of the campus sustainability initiative and the launch of the Office of Sustainability. This presentation will provide background on the sustainability plan and the academic companion document. It will seek your support and advice for making progress on the aspirational goals and strategies that will guide the campus sustainability initiative to the year 2020.  The University of Alberta has a growing positive reputation for being a leader enabling the sustainability transformation in higher education in Canada and beyond.
