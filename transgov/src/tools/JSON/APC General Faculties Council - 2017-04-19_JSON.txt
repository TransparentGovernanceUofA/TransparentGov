There have been no students registered in either major since the University of Alberta began officially maintaining the Augustana Faculty student records in September 2006.    Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Will require removal of the programs and all references to the programs from the University Calendar: Augustana Faculty Bachelor of Music section.

After approval by the Board of Governors, the proposal will be submitted to the Ministry of Advanced Education for approval.  Supplementary Notes and context Since September 2006, no students have been registered in either of the Liturgical Arts or Musical Arts BMus majors offered by Augustana Faculty. Official student reporting by the University to the Government of Alberta does show 3 students registered in the Musical Arts Major from 2006-\n2016.  However, close examination determined all 3 were actually Undeclared majors who were reported as Musical Arts majors due to the reporting requirements stipulated by the Government of Alberta.  The last reported Musical Arts major was in 2010. Given the lack of registrations in these majors, consultation with the Office of the Provost and Vice President (Academic) and the Government of Alberta recommended moving forward with the termination of these majors, without a period of suspension.
