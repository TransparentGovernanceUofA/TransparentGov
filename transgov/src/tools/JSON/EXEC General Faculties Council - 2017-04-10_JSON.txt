Furthermore, in order to address a key concern of the CAS:T constituency, the mandate provided the ability to establish greater position security, by adopting a “contingent” appointment option for CAS:T Agreement staff members, and a range of appointment options more in keeping with the work done and working conditions experienced by CAS:T staff.
