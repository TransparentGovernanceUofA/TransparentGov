This is your opportunity to contribute to the transformation of academic governance at the University of Alberta.  As members of this committee, you are uniquely placed to provide input and ideas to the ad hoc committee – the chance to make a difference is now. If you have additional ideas after the meeting, it is not too late; contact any member of the ad hoc committee to share your ideas. But ideally you will share with your committee colleagues during the meeting and allow the synergy of the group to build upon ideas. The following questions are provided to start the conversation and Committee members are encouraged to reflect on these, and any other issues you think of, and come prepared for a discussion of whether and what changes you’d like to see. •   Are there reasons for clarifying or changing the mandate of your committee? •   Can improvements be made to the operations of your committee, including how issues come to your attention and how you interact with other GFC committees? •   Is the membership and composition of the Standing Committee appropriate? •   Is there clarity on your Committee’s relationship to full GFC in terms of when issues and decisions should go to GFC and how to report back to GFC? •   Upon reflection, have there been times when an item has been approved with delegated authority that should have gone to full GFC?
