The University of Alberta’s on bloodborne pathogens is designed to align with Alberta Health Services immunization standards and to limit the possibility of transmission of bloodborne pathogens within the educational setting. The Impact of the Proposal is To revise the University Bloodborne Pathogens Regulation to align with current practice in infection control and prevention of bloodborne pathogens.  Changes include clarification of student responsibilities with regards to medical testing and immunization for the Faculties of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences (Dietetic Interns) Medicine and Dentistry (Medicine, Dentistry, Dental Hygiene, Medical Laboratory Science, Radiation Therapy), Nursing, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Physical Education and Recreation, and Rehabilitation Medicine (Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Speech Language Pathology). Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) University Bloodborne Pathogens Policy of the University Calendar Timeline/Implementation Date 2017-2018 Estimated Cost and funding source Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) Supplementary Notes and context Through the upcoming year, further work will be conducted leading to the rescission of GFC policy 108 and to move the remaining sections as appropriate to UAPPOL.

These values are drawn from the principles on which the University of Alberta was founded in 1908 and reflect a dynamic, modern institution of higher learning, leading change nationally and internationally.  Above all, we value intellectual integrity, freedom of inquiry and expression, and the equality and dignity of all persons as the foundation of ethical conduct in research, teaching, learning, and service.  We value excellence in teaching, research, and creative activity that enriches learning experiences, advances knowledge, inspires engaged citizenship, and promotes the public good.  We value learners at all stages of life and strive to provide an intellectually rewarding educational environment for all.  We value academic freedom and institutional autonomy as fundamental to open inquiry and the pursuit of truth.  We value diversity, inclusivity, and equity across and among our people, campuses, and disciplines.  We value creativity and innovation from the genesis of ideas through to the dissemination of knowledge.  We value the history and traditions of our university, celebrating with pride our people, achievements, and contributions to society. http://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nStrategic Goals  Goal:  EXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service. To excel and achieve our full potential as an institution and as individuals, the University of Alberta will sustain a learning and research culture that inspires, supports, and champions high professional standards and outstanding achievements in basic and applied research and scholarship, creative activity, administration, and governance. We will ensure that learning experiences at our university are of the highest quality, based on a practice of continuous improvement and innovation in teaching. From our broad-based strength as a comprehensive, research-\nintensive public university, we will highlight current and emerging areas of global distinction and leadership by building a portfolio of signature areas that distinguish us from among our peer institutions and exemplify the University of Alberta’s capacity to engage in big questions and global challenges. Goal:  SUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by attracting and stewarding the resources we need to deliver excellence to the benefit of all Albertans. To achieve our strategic goals, the University of Alberta will attract and steward the resources we need to excel and deliver our core teaching and research mission at the high standard expected by all Albertans. We will build on our capacities for securing new sources of operating, capital, research, and philanthropic funding. We will continue to model and advance teaching and learning in the area of environmental sustainability on our campuses and in our work. We must sustain our people by promoting health, wellness, and safety as a defining feature of the University of Alberta’s learning and working experience, and by maintaining and enhancing the university’s essential teaching, learning, and research infrastructure. Continuous improvement and cross-unit engagement and co-operation will define our approach to governance and administration to ensure that our systems, policies, and procedures facilitate the achievement of our shared goals. Objective 21:  Encourage continuous improvement in administrative, governance, planning and stewardship systems, procedures, and policies that enable students, faculty, staff, and the institutions as a whole to achieve shared strategic goals. Strategy i: Encourage transparency and improve communication across the university through clear consultation and decision-making processes, substantive and timely communication of information, and access to shared, reliable institutional data.  Strategy ii: Ensure that individual and institutional annual review processes align with and support key institutional strategic goals.  Strategy iii: Consolidate unit review and strategic planning processes, and where possible, align with accreditation processes, to ensure efficient assessment practices.  Strategy iv: Facilitate easy access to and use of university services and systems; reduce duplication and complexity; and encourage cross-\ninstitutional administrative and operational collaboration.  Strategy v: Develop a set of equitable, meaningful, and relevant measures to monitor our progress toward strategic goals and develop the tools required to report on them.

(2) Any recommendations from the general faculties council to the board must be transmitted to the board through the president. (3) A general faculties council may delegate any of its powers, duties and functions under this Act, including the powers referred to in section 31, as it sees fit and may prescribe conditions governing the exercise or performance of any delegated power, duty or function, including the power of subdelegation.” 2. General Faculties Council Terms of Reference / 3. Mandate “Powers Retained by General Faculties Council” All powers and responsibilities under Section 26 of the PSLA not expressly delegated now or in the future shall be retained by General Faculties Council. (GFC 02 DEC 1966) The issues which remain with GFC or which would be referred by a Standing Committee to GFC would generally be in the nature of the following: • high level strategic and stewardship policy issues or matters of significant risk to the University; • alterations to the mandate, terms of reference, composition, or structure of a Standing Committee; • those things which a Standing Committee considers to be of major strategic significance to or long-term impact on the University; • those matters on which, in the opinion of a Standing Committee chair, there has been a strong division of opinion within the Standing Committee; and • issues in which there is a lack of clarity as to which Standing Committee is responsible. 3. General Faculties Council Terms of Reference / 4. General Faculties Council Procedures […] New Committees and Ad Hoc Committees a) New Committees: When GFC establishes a new committee, GFC (or delegate body) shall provide clear, explicit, and detailed terms of reference. (GFC 24 NOV 1980)  b)  Ad Hoc Committees: When an ad hoc committee is in doubt as to the scope of its terms of reference, it shall seek clarification and guidance from the Executive Committee of General Faculties Council. (EXEC JUN 1971)  When GFC establishes an ad hoc committee, a reporting date shall be set by the Secretary to GFC.
