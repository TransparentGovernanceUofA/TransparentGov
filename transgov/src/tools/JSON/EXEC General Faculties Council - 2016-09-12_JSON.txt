The University of Alberta’s on bloodborne pathogens is designed to align with Alberta Health Services immunization standards and to limit the possibility of transmission of bloodborne pathogens within the educational setting. The Impact of the Proposal is To revise the University Bloodborne Pathogens Regulation to align with current practice in infection control and prevention of bloodborne pathogens.  Changes include clarification of student responsibilities with regards to medical testing and immunization for the Faculties of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences (Dietetic Interns) Medicine and Dentistry (Medicine, Dentistry, Dental Hygiene, Medical Laboratory Science, Radiation Therapy), Nursing, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Physical Education and Recreation, and Rehabilitation Medicine (Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Speech Language Pathology).
