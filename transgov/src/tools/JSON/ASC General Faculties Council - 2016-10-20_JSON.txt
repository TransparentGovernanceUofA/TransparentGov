Objective 21: Encourage continuous improvement in administrative, governance, planning, and stewardship systems, procedures, and policies that enable students, faculty, staff, and the institution as a whole to achieve shared strategic goals. Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment of students to take courses. The Board has delegated its authority over these areas to GFC. GFC has thus established, and delegated certain powers to, an Academic Standards Committee. 2.  PSLA “29(1) A faculty council may:  […] (c) provide for the admission of students to the faculty, (d) determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of studies in the faculty […] subject to any conditions or restrictions that are imposed by the general faculties council. 3.  GFC ASC Terms of Reference (Mandate of the Committee) “D. Alberta Transfer Guide i. ASC approves, for inclusion in the Alberta Transfer Guide, courses for transfer credit to the University of Alberta which are offered by non-\nUniversity institutions in Alberta. Approval will be based upon an assessment of course content and level of instructor qualifications.  ii. ASC denies courses for transfer credit to the University of Alberta which are offered by non-University institutions in Alberta.  iii. ASC monitors the entries in the Alberta Transfer Guide relevant to the University of Alberta.  iv. ASC rescinds, if necessary, the entries in the Alberta Transfer Guide relevant to the University of Alberta.”  4.  UAPPOL Transfer Credit Articulation Procedure (Overview and Procedure):  “The University of Alberta will accept for transfer credit the courses recommended by Faculties and approved by ASC for inclusion Item 4 - page 2\nin the Alberta Transfer guide, to the extent that the courses fit the degree program that the student wishes to enter. Credit for such courses will be considered in a credit-no credit basis only and will not be included in the University grade point average calculation on the University transcript. Faculties may have other requirements…Transfer credit is assessed on an individual course-by-course basis for by a block transfer agreement.” 5. GFC Academic Standards Committee Terms of Reference (Mandate of the Committee) “A. Definitions i. “Routine and/or Editorial […] the term “routine and/or editorial” refers to proposals which do not involve or affect other Faculties or units; do not form part of a proposal for a new program; and which do not involve alteration of an existing quota or establishment of a new quota. Editorial or routine changes include any and all changes to the wording of an admissions or academic standing policy. […]  B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, Term Work, Examinations, International Baccalaureate (IB), Advanced Placement (AP) i. All proposals from the Faculties or the Administration related to admission and transfer, to the academic standing of students, to institutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures and to term work policies and procedures are submitted to the Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) (or delegate) who chairs the GFC Academic Standards Committee. ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these proposals. ii. ASC acts for GFC in approving routine and/or editorial changes to both admission/transfer policies and academic standing regulations” 3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as Item 4 - page 3\nthe councils of such Faculties will determine.” 4.  UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006).” b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.” 5.  PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). 6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  “All current academic standing regulations, including academic standing categories, University graduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be those prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the University Calendar.” 7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All proposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing academic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the Administration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties will also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any proposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to academic standing, including promotion and graduation. If the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to be in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate University governance process(es). In considering these proposals, governance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices. Normally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or its delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” Attachments  Item 4 - page 4\n1.

The General Academic Standing Requirements have been added to the Calendar with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 and the allowance of only one failed course. The Impact of the Proposal is For the admission GPA calculation a solid foundation in anatomy is key to understanding human movement and the pathological processes that could arise as a result of disease or injury. The advanced anatomy course covered in the MScPT program is intensive and requires good foundational knowledge for students admitted to the program. To facilitate student success in the MScPT anatomy course, we believe recency of knowledge is important as is a good understanding of the material. Therefore we propose a change to require that anatomy be completed in the previous 5 years. For many students anatomy does not fall within their most recent 60 credits, we believe that students may work harder to learn and understand the content if it is specifically weighted in the GPA calculation. For the addition of the General Academic Standing Requirements section, FGSR requires programs that have higher minimum cumulative grade point average compared to FGSR’s minimum to provide this in the calendar.

Strategy i: Develop continuing and professional education programs that connect the knowledge-mobilization activities of the university’s faculty members to the needs of diverse learner communities. Strategy ii: Create a wide range of opportunities, both in person and virtual, for broad, learning-centred programs for alumni and other communities of learners engaging in continuing and professional education. Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment (Section 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic Standards Committee (ASC). 2.

Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please UquoteU legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment. The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC and GFC ASC. (Sections 26(1), 60(1)(c) and (d)). 2. GFC Academic Standards Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate) “B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, Term Work, Examinations, International Baccalaureate (IB), Advanced Placement (AP) i. All proposals from the from the Faculties or the Administration related to admission and transfer, to the academic standing of students, to institutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures and to term work policies and procedures are submitted to the Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) (or delegate) who chairs the GFC Academic Standards Committee. ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these proposals.” Item 7 - page 2\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\n3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). 4. UAPPOL Admissions Policy:  “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.). The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 5. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (I.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.” 6. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). 7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  “All current academic standing regulations, including academic standing categories, University graduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be those prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the University Calendar.” 8. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures:  “All proposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing academic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties Item 7 - page 3\nor the Administration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties will also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any proposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to academic standing, including promotion and graduation. If the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to be in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate University governance process(es). In considering these proposals, governance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices. Normally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or its delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” Attachments (each to be numbered 1 - 9) 1.
