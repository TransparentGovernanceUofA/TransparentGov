Examples of experiential learning may include: Co-op programs, field experiences, internships, mandatory professional practice, service learning, and study abroad. For this discussion, please consider the following questions: - How should we define experiential learning at the University of Alberta? - How do we help faculty and students recognize existing experiential learning opportunities? - How do we increase access to and participation in experiential learning opportunities? - What do we need to create new experiential learning opportunities which are aligned with program goals?
