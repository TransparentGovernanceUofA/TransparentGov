            "Description": "Details Responsibility Board of Governors Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) The Health Science Council has been working with University Health Centre, Office of Emergency Management, Alberta Health Services, and all Health Sciences Faculties on developing a consolidated medical testing /immunization requirement calendar section to replace the individual faculty calendar sections.   The University of Alberta’s on bloodborne pathogens is designed to align with Alberta Health Services immunization standards and to limit the possibility of transmission of bloodborne pathogens within the educational setting. The Impact of the Proposal is To revise the existing regulation to align with current practice in infection control and prevention of bloodborne pathogens.  Changes include clarification of student responsibilities with regards to medical testing and immunization for the Faculties of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences (Dietetic Interns) Medicine and Dentistry (Medicine, Dentistry, Dental Hygiene, Medical Laboratory Science, Radiation Therapy), Nursing, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Physical Education and Recreation, and Rehabilitation Medicine (Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Speech Language Pathology). In addition, naming this as the University Infectious Diseases Regulation more accurately reflects the content of the regulation. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) University Bloodborne Pathogens Policy of the University Calendar Timeline/Implementation Date 2017-2018 Estimated Cost and funding source Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) Through the upcoming year, further work will be conducted leading to the rescission of GFC policy 108 on Bloodborne Pathogens and to move the remaining sections as appropriate to UAPPOL.

(2) Any recommendations from the general faculties council to the board must be transmitted to the board through the president. (3) A general faculties council may delegate any of its powers, duties and functions under this Act, including the powers referred to in section 31, as it sees fit and may prescribe conditions governing the exercise or performance of any delegated power, duty or function, including the power of subdelegation.” 2. General Faculties Council Terms of Reference / 3. Mandate “Powers Retained by General Faculties Council” All powers and responsibilities under Section 26 of the PSLA not expressly delegated now or in the future shall be retained by General Faculties Council. (GFC 02 DEC 1966) The issues which remain with GFC or which would be referred by a Standing Committee to GFC would generally be in the nature of the following: • high level strategic and stewardship policy issues or matters of significant risk to the University; • alterations to the mandate, terms of reference, composition, or structure of a Standing Committee; • those things which a Standing Committee considers to be of major strategic significance to or long-term impact on the University; • those matters on which, in the opinion of a Standing Committee chair, there has been a strong division of opinion within the Standing Committee; and • issues in which there is a lack of clarity as to which Standing Committee is responsible. 3. General Faculties Council Terms of Reference / 4. General Faculties Council Procedures […] New Committees and Ad Hoc Committees a) New Committees: When GFC establishes a new committee, GFC (or delegate body) shall provide clear, explicit, and detailed terms of reference. (GFC 24 NOV 1980)  b)  Ad Hoc Committees: When an ad hoc committee is in doubt as to the scope of its terms of reference, it shall seek clarification and guidance from the Executive Committee of General Faculties Council. (EXEC JUN 1971)   When GFC establishes an ad hoc committee, a reporting date shall be set by the Secretary to GFC. (EXEC 03 MAY 1982)  Ad hoc committees shall be considered as being discharged once their reports are received or accepted by General Faculties Council unless the committee recommends otherwise, or General Faculties Council requests it to continue. (GFC 29 APR 1968) 4. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference/3. Mandate of the Committee:   “To act as the executive body of General Faculties Council and, in general, carry out the functions delegated to it by General Faculties Council.”  […] 5. Agendas of General Faculties Council GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those agenda items appear on each GFC agenda.  When ordering items, the GFC Executive Committee will be mindful of any matters that are of particular concern to students during March and April so that the student leaders who bring those items forward are able to address these items at GFC before their terms end. (EXEC 06 NOV 2006)  […] With respect to recommendations from other bodies and other GFC committees, however, the role of the Executive Committee shall be to examine and debate the substance of reports or recommendations and to decide if an item is ready to be forwarded to the full governing body. The Executive Committee may decide to refer a proposal back to the originating body, to refer the proposal to another body or individual for study or review, or to take other action in order to ready a proposal for consideration by General Faculties Council. When the GFC Executive Committee forwards a proposal to GFC, it shall make a recommendation that GFC endorse; endorse with suggested amendments; not endorse; or forward the proposal with no comment.” Attachments (each to be numbered 1 - 2) 1.
