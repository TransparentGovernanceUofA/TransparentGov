            "Description": "https://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan\n2 Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation: At the end of September, we hosted the 2nd annual Building Reconciliation Forum. Building Reconciliation brought together Canadian university presidents and their leadership teams, First Nations, Métis and Inuit leaders, student leaders, Indigenous scholars, and scholars dedicated to research that is conducted in partnership with—and is meaningful to—Indigenous peoples. The U of A was proud to host this important event, and I was honoured to be a part of the proceedings. I found it a remarkable opportunity to listen and learn from diverse and compelling perspectives on the role of post-secondary education in reconciliation. I’m heartened by the many reconciliation initiatives originating from all corners of our university.  They indicate that the University of Alberta will continue work towards thoughtful, respectful, and meaningful reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. Universities Canada I recently accepted an invitiation to join the Universities Canada board of directors, effective immediately. Universities Canada is made up of 97 member institutions from across the country, and focuses on building collaboration amongst universities and governments, the private sector, communities and international partners. I look forward to my membership on the board of directors as an opportunity to cultivate our relationship with the federal government, and advance the U of A’s strengths and interests at the national level.  International Travel This October, I witnessed first hand the breadth, depth and reach of the University of Alberta’s relationships and partnerships in China.  During our tour of China, we signed memoranda of understanding with three different institutions: Tsinghua University (Joint Energy Systems Research Centre), East China Normal University (advanced scientific research centre), and  China Electric Technology Group Corporation (research service agreement). China’s vice-minister of education commended the University of Alberta’s high level of engagement in China. In addition to opening the door to many partnerships, that engagement recently put us into position to lead the creation of the Canadian Learning Initiative in China (CLIC), which enables two-way, study-abroad opportunities for both Canadian and Chinese students.   I have provided a more detailed relflection about the tour on The Quad. I depart for India near the end of November, and I’m looking forward to another productive and engaging trip. I have several government and industry meetings scheduled, and I will be participating in a panel discussion on alternative energy solutions at the 2016 PetroTech Conference. I will provide updates following the trip.  https://www.ualberta.ca/news-and-events/newsarticles/2016/october/walking-the-walk-on-truth-and-reconciliation\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2016/11/from-presidents-desk-nov-1.html\n3 Academic Excellence At the end of October, 20 graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and professors were recognized at the annual Killam celebration for their outstanding academic achievement, leadership, and mentorship. The Killam awards are a tradition that stretches back nearly half a century at the University of Alberta. The U of A was recently named one of Canada’s top five universities as part of the Maclean’s annual university rankings. The Maclean’s ranking is based on five broad areas: quality of students, faculty, resources, student support, and reputation. The ranking is a reflection of the high-quality, supportive learning environment that we’ve created at the University of Alberta. I want to thank each of you for the contributions that you make to this great university.  Senior Leadership Transitions As many of you know, Richard Fedorak has been appointed dean of the Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry for the period November 1, 2016 to June 30, 2021. He has served as interim dean of the faculty since February of 2015. I also want to welcome Gitta Kulczycki, who started her term as vice-president (finance and administration) on November 1.  Lastly, I want to thank the 1200 faculty, staff, and students who volunteered during the Fort McMurray crisis earlier this summer, and who were recognized at an appreciation event on November 9. As the story of the university’s response came together, I was reminded of how proud I am to be a member of this supportive, thoughtful, and engaged community.

A new sustainability plan has been developed for 2016-2020 as well as a companion document to inform academic planning. The new sustainability plan outlines areas for improving our institution’s sustainability performance and educational programming. It will be used to help guide strategic decisions across the institution, program decisions regarding outreach initiatives, operational improvements and enhancements to academic programs. The University of Alberta has a growing positive reputation for being a leader enabling the sustainability transformation in higher education in Canada and beyond. As a result of the goals and strategies outlined in the 2012 – 2016 Sustainability Plan, the University of Alberta moved to a Gold Rating (2014) from a Silver Rating (2012) in the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System. We have also been recognized as one of Canada’s Greenest Employers for 8 consecutive years.

These values are drawn from the principles on which the University of Alberta was founded in 1908 and reflect a dynamic, modern institution of higher learning, leading change nationally and internationally.  Above all, we value intellectual integrity, freedom of inquiry and expression, and the equality and dignity of all persons as the foundation of ethical conduct in research, teaching, learning, and service.  We value excellence in teaching, research, and creative activity that enriches learning experiences, advances knowledge, inspires engaged citizenship, and promotes the public good.  We value learners at all stages of life and strive to provide an intellectually rewarding educational environment for all.  We value academic freedom and institutional autonomy as fundamental to open inquiry and the pursuit of truth.  We value diversity, inclusivity, and equity across and among our people, campuses, and disciplines.  We value creativity and innovation from the genesis of ideas through to the dissemination of knowledge.  We value the history and traditions of our university, celebrating with pride our people, achievements, and contributions to society. Strategic Goals  Goal:  EXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service. To excel and achieve our full potential as an institution and as individuals, the University of Alberta will sustain a learning and research culture that inspires, supports, and champions high professional standards and outstanding achievements in basic and applied research and scholarship, creative activity, administration, and governance. We will ensure that learning experiences at our university are of the highest quality, based on a practice of continuous improvement and innovation in teaching. From our broad-based strength as a comprehensive, research-\nintensive public university, we will highlight current and emerging areas of global distinction and leadership by building a portfolio of signature areas that distinguish us from among our peer institutions and exemplify the University of Alberta’s capacity to engage in big questions and global challenges. Goal:  SUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by attracting and stewarding the resources we need to deliver excellence to the benefit of all Albertans. To achieve our strategic goals, the University of Alberta will attract and steward the resources we need to excel and deliver our core teaching and research mission at the high standard expected by all Albertans. We will build on our capacities for securing new sources of operating, capital, research, and philanthropic funding. We will continue to model and advance teaching and learning in the area of environmental sustainability on our campuses and in our work. We must sustain our people by promoting health, wellness, and safety as a defining feature of the University of Alberta’s learning and working experience, and by maintaining and enhancing the university’s essential teaching, learning, and research infrastructure. Continuous improvement and cross-unit engagement and co-operation will define our approach to governance and administration to ensure that our systems, policies, and procedures facilitate the achievement of our shared goals. Objective 21:  Encourage continuous improvement in administrative, governance, planning and stewardship systems, procedures, and policies that enable students, faculty, staff, and the institutions as a whole to achieve shared strategic goals. Strategy i: Encourage transparency and improve communication across the university through clear consultation and decision-making processes, substantive and timely communication of information, and access to shared, reliable institutional data.  Strategy ii: Ensure that individual and institutional annual review processes align with and support key institutional strategic goals.  Strategy iii: Consolidate unit review and strategic planning processes, and where possible, align with accreditation processes, to ensure efficient assessment practices.  Strategy iv: Facilitate easy access to and use of university services and systems; reduce duplication and complexity; and encourage cross-\ninstitutional administrative and operational collaboration.  Strategy v: Develop a set of equitable, meaningful, and relevant measures to monitor our progress toward strategic goals and develop the tools required to report on them.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment (Sections 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic Standards Committee (GFC ASC). 3. GFC Academic Standards Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate)  “The ASC is responsible for making recommendations and/or for providing advice to GFC, its Executive Committee, and/or the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) on the matters set out below, which include such areas as admissions and transfer, including admission and transfer to Faculties, admission of Open Studies students, academic standing policies and general university admission policies, and all institutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures.” […] “B.

ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these proposals. (GFC 29 SEP 2003) (GFC 31 MAY 2005) (EXEC 04 DEC 2006)  […]  v. ASC provides advice or recommends to APC on general University admission or transfer policies affecting students, including policies which affect Open Studies.” 4. GFC Academic Planning Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate) “7. Admission, Transfer and Academic Standing a.

GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference  “5. Agendas of General Faculties Council  GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those agenda items appear on each GFC agenda. […]  When recommendations are forwarded to General Faculties Council from APC, the role of the Executive shall be to decide the order in which items should be considered by GFC. The Executive Committee is responsible for providing general advice to the Chair about proposals being forwarded from APC to GFC.” 6. UAPPOL Admissions Policy Those responsible for admissions decisions will interpret and apply the established admission requirements and regulations, in a transparent process, in order to admit the best-qualified applicants from the total number of applicants who are eligible for admission, in accordance with Faculty enrolment targets or program quotas. The basis on which a student is admitted, and any academic provisions of admission, will not diminish or eliminate that student's rights and responsibilities, as detailed in the University Calendar.

Supplementary Notes and context Proposed changes to the Statement on Equity in Student Affairs in the University Calendar will go forward with this proposal to the GFC Executive Committee and General Faculties Council.  In 2011, the Board of Governors approved UAPPOL human resource policies and procedures to take effect July 1, 2011. At that time, the https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Procedures/Academic-Staff-Posting-and-Advertising-Procedure.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Procedures/Academic-Staff-Posting-and-Advertising-Procedure.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Procedures/Support-Staff-Posting-and-Advertising-Procedure.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Procedures/Support-Staff-Posting-and-Advertising-Procedure.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Procedures/Academic-Staff-Posting-and-Advertising-Procedure.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Procedures/Academic-Staff-Posting-and-Advertising-Procedure.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Procedures/Support-Staff-Posting-and-Advertising-Procedure.pdf\nBoard of Governors noted that, following approval, the respective Vice-\nPresidents would manage the procedures/procedural changes within the policy without having to return to the Board of Governors for ongoing approval. This authority has not been reflected in the documents to date; at this time, the proposal seeks to have this confirmed. In addition, the changes to the Equity Statement which align with current legislative requirements, are also an important statement of the University’s position and practice in this area. Work is currently being conducted to develop a more overarching University statement.
