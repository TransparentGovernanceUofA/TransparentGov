In 2010, the Helping Individuals at Risk Policy (HIAR) was introduced and an intake function was created to work in conjunction with the Office of Safe Disclosure and Human Rights (SDHR). The policy requires that annual reporting to General Faculties Council (GFC) and to the Board of Governors will occur after each year of operation. The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the activities of each office and to comment on trends and issues in these.

Timeline/Implementation Date September 1, 2018 Supplementary Notes and context The current structure of the Faculty of Arts Bachelor of Arts (BA) Basic Requirements has been in place since the 2006 – 2007 academic year. In November 2011, Arts Faculty Council approved a five year Academic Plan that included a systematic review of the BA general requirements.  The ensuing consultation process has led to this final version of the BA Renewal Proposal. The goal of the BA Curriculum Renewal is to develop a sustainable BA program that provides Arts students with an exemplary undergraduate degree.  A renewed BA in the Faculty of Arts must be flexible enough to accommodate the exceptional breadth and depth in programming offered in our Faculty. This renewed BA must also continue to enable a broad range of pedagogical methods, from traditional instructional strategies to community-engaged experiential learning, while retaining our rigorous academic standards. The Faculty of Arts has provided a web link on our homepage to the entire history of the BA Renewal process, proposal and appendices.

These changes will affect calendar section entries for the Bachelor of Arts (BA), BA Honors Program Requirements, and the After Degree Programs (included here) Alignment/Compliance Alignment with Guiding Documents BUILD  This BA renewal proposal forms a critical part of a broader effort by the Faculty of Arts to offer a truly outstanding BA program that will attract and retain the very best and brightest students from Alberta, Canada, and the world. EXPERIENCE  The revised BA will provide space for students to engage in one or more of the variety of exceptional experiential learning opportunities, whether it be research, study abroad, community-\nservice learning, or work experience. EXCEL  We believe that the proposed BA redesign will make the Faculty of Arts attractive to students across Canada, creating room for distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service, since the redesign allows departments to refocus course offerings in areas of excellence and interest to students. ENGAGE  Faculty emphasis is on community engagement.  The revised BA allows us to expand opportunities for students within their degree programs to reach broader and more diverse community partners while deepening ties to current partners.  (for example, allowing more room for students to engage in work experience, community service-learning, international learning experiences, and research with their instructors in the community). SUSTAIN  The revised BA maintains breadth and depth in study, while allowing Departments the opportunity redirect teaching resources to areas of excellence.  The proposed requirements facilitate more straightforward transition for students transferring to Arts from other programs at the University of Alberta and other post-secondary institutions than is currently possible.  A flexible Arts degree means that our students will easily be able to accommodate any mandated Faculty or University-wide Indigenous studies requirement in their degrees, should this requirement be embraced institutionally.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs (Section 26(1)).  2.

            "Motion": " THAT the GFC Executive Committee, with delegated authority from General Faculties Council, approve the new Course Designator of HADVC (History of Art, Design and Visual Culture), Faculty of Arts, to take effect Fall 2017. ",
            "Action Requested": "N/A",
            "Date": "2017-01-16",
            "Committee": "EXEC",
            "Proposed By": "Lesley Cormack, Dean, Faculty of Arts (to be represented by R Nagel, Associate Dean, Student Programs) ",
            "Presenter": " Natalie Loveless, Assistant Professor, Department of Art & Design ",
            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) The proposed calendar changes will: - Change the course prefix from ART H to HADVC for all courses taught in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture area within the Art & Design Department (see Attachment 1) - Ensure that both the name of the BA major and related course prefix are consistent with one another.  Currently, the major is “History of Art, Design and Visual Culture”, and the related subject is called Art History (ART H).    The Impact of the Proposal is In 2002, the Art History area changed its subject name to the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture in order to more clearly articulate its move away from an exclusive focus on the fine arts (painting, printmaking, drawing and sculpture) and toward a more inclusive curriculum covering the many diverse manifestations of visual production. Since 2002, courses have been re-designed to explicitly include design (architecture, interior design, landscape design, anatomical illustration, typography, etc.) and new courses have been added to broaden the in depth study of particular aspects of visual culture (history of design and history of photography, for example). The geographic scope of our offerings has also expanded during this time to include work from regions of the world that do not subscribe to a western understanding of the phrase “Art History.”  This move, from ART H to HADVC, will finalize a disciplinary and curricular shift that has occurred over the last 15 years. There may be a concern that changing the courses from \"ART H\" to \"HADVC\" will make that acronym less instantly understandable. Fortunately, the full name of these courses comes first when students are using the ‘Browse Course Catalog’ function in Bear Tracks.  They will see \"History of Art, Design and Visual Culture (HADVC)\" in the listings.  Abbreviations such as MLCS, HUCO, etc. do not immediately clarify their content as well as this change will for our courses.  In addition, using the abbreviation HADVC instead of ART H will better reflect the breadth and depth of the course offerings and research in our HADVC area to our prospective students, particularly when they are comparing our program to those of our competitor programs. It is important that the \"face\" we present, through Bear Tracks, our website, etc., is indicative of the contemporary content and design-specific courses we offer, in addition to the more traditional and historical content that one might expect in a course called \"ART H\" or Art History. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) This is a new prefix for courses offered in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture subject area.  Timeline/Implementation Date Fall 2017 Estimated Cost and funding source Very small administrative cost to implement changes in Bear Tracks by ETT, and in Academic Advisement and other materials by the Faculty and Department Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) The Department will advise students by email, specifically to students in Art & Design. Students in the BFA and BDes programs meet individually with the Department undergraduate advisor and will also be reminded verbally. The Department website publishes all of their courses and will continue to do so under new prefix. Arts students who are not in the BFA or BDes program will receive notification via  the weekly bulletin for students.   We will also make changes to the Academic Advisement module to alert students in the BA program that HADVC courses can be used toward their Group 1 (Fine Arts) requirement. We have consulted with Anna Vocioni, Assistant Registrar, and ETT is aware these changes need to be made in Bear Tracks, which will reflect HADVC for the beginning of  2017-18 registration in March.
