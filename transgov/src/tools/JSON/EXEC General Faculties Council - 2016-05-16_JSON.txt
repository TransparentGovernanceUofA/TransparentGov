            "Presenter": " Steven Dew, Provost and Vice-President (Academic) Subject Proposed New Copyright Regulations ",
            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Vice-President (Research) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) To clarify when the staff member owns copyright, and when the University owns copyright. The Impact of the Proposal is To update and revise the language in Article 10 related to copyright in the various academic collective agreements (APO Agreement, Faculty Agreement, FSO Agreement, Librarian Agreement, CAST Agreement, SOTS Agreement, TRAS Agreement). Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Article 10 in the various Academic Staff Agreements. Timeline/Implementation Date July 1, 2016 Estimated Cost N/A Sources of Funding N/A Notes The rules regarding copyright created by academic staff at the University are based on two documents; the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) and the collective agreements between the Board and the AASUA.   The PSLA states: Intellectual Property 68(1) Unless otherwise agreed to by the board, the ownership of any invention, work, information or material, regardless of form, including any patent, copyright, technological or industrial design process or trademark acquired or produced by an officer of the post-secondary institution or an employee of the board that results from or is connected with the officer’s or employee’s duties or employment vests in the board and may be made available to the public under conditions, on payment of fees or royalties or otherwise, as the board may determine. The collective agreements between the Board of Governors and AASUA have contained Copyright Regulations (as Articles and/or Appendices) since 1977.  Over the years, there has been a significant amount of confusion when the parties have attempted to interpret the Copyright Regulations as it is not clear from the language when the University would own copyright and when it would be owned by the staff member.  The generally accepted practice (although not strictly based on the language) has been to acknowledge that academic staff own the copyright in their teaching materials, but the University has some sort of  limited license to use that material. In 2010, the University of Alberta and the AASUA agreed to form an “Agreement Review Committee” that would examine two aspects of intellectual property: a) copyright and b) the emerging issue of intellectual property that is not covered by patent or copyright practices.  The ARC that was created has focused solely on the first issue - copyright.  This ARC has been meeting regularly since and has developed proposed new Copyright Regulations which would replace the existing regulations in their entirety.  The ARC believes that the new language creates greater certainty as it relates to copyright ownership and use.   The key elements of the proposed new Regulations include: 1.    Clear ownership by academic staff of copyright in works they create as a result of or connected with their duties or employment. 2.    An immediate, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable and irrevocable license to the University to use these works for purposes related to its approved mandate. 3.    A more limited license to the University to use a staff member’s detailed teaching materials, for example if the staff member is unable or unavailable to deliver all or part of a course assigned to that staff member during that academic year. 4.    Ownership by the University of copyright of works created by a staff member in the course of performing administrative or management duties or activities.   5.     A clear statement that a staff member’s copyright in works created as part of a sponsored research agreement is governed by the terms of that agreement.  This gives the University the right to alter copyright ownership in a sponsored research agreement, the way it is currently able to be done for Patentable Intellectual Property. *It is important to note that the proposed Regulations deal with copyright that is created by a University of Alberta academic staff member in performing his employment duties.  It does not apply to the use by the University of copyright materials from other sources (textbooks, library books, online sources, etc).  There is a separate policy suite being drafted that deals with such issues. Alignment/Compliance Alignment with Guiding Documents Dare to Discover, Dare to Deliver, Comprehensive Institutional Plan,  academic collective agreements Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1.  Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA):  Alberta’s Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) gives the Board of Governors the authority to “develop, manage and operate, alone or in co-operation with any person or organization, programs, services and facilities for the educational or cultural advancement of the people of Alberta” (Section 60(1)).   Further, the Board of Governors “must consider the recommendations of the general faculties council, if any, on matters of academic import prior to providing for […] any other activities the board considers necessary or advantageous”  (Section 19(e)). 2.  Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA):  Section 26(1) states that, “[s]ubject to the authority of the board, a general faculties council is responsible for the academic affairs of the university and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, has the authority to […] (o) make recommendations to the board with respect to affiliation with other institutions, academic planning, campus planning, a building program, the budget, the regulation of residences and dining halls, procedures in respect of appointments, promotions, salaries, tenure and dismissals, and any other matters considered by the general faculties council to be of interest to the university […].” Further, the PSLA, states in Section 31(1) that “[t]he general faculties council has general supervision of student affairs at a university […].” 3.

Mandate of the Committee) “The Committee on the Learning Environment is responsible for making recommendations concerning policy matters and action matters with respect to the following: […] b) To review and, as necessary, recommend to the GFC Academic Planning Committee or the GFC Executive Committee policies on teaching, learning, teaching evaluation, and recognition for teaching that promote the University’s Academic Plan. […] i) To consider any matter deemed by the GFC Committee on the Learning Environment to be within the purview of its general responsibility.” 4. GFC Academic Planning Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee) “The Academic Planning Committee (APC) is GFC’s senior committee dealing with academic, financial and planning issues. As such, it is not only responsible to GFC (or the Board) for the specific matters itemized below, but may also ask to consider or recommend to GFC on any academic issue, including: 1) those issues under the purview of other GFC committees, 2) any academic issue related to restructuring, 3) any research-related issue, or 4) issues linked to academic service units where those issues have a significant academic impact. In like manner, the President, Provost and Vice-President (academic) or other Vice-\nPresidents may refer any matter to APC for consideration or recommendation to GFC. APC is also responsible to GFC for promoting an optimal learning environment for students and excellence in teaching, research, and graduate studies. (GFC 29 SEP 2003)” 5. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee) “5. Agendas of General Faculties Council GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those agenda items appear on each GFC agenda.

The composition of the ARC’s membership has changed significantly over time; the Vice-President (Research) has been a member from the beginning, as has Geoffrey Rockwell (Department of Philosophy). They have provided important continuity to the discussions over the past six years. During 2010, before detailed discussions began, a review of the copyright regulations of some of the University’s peer institutions in Canada (McGill, UBC, University of Toronto) and the US (University of  Wisconsin, University of Michigan, Penn State) was carried out.  This provided important context for the discussion about possible changes to the University’s copyright regulations. While significant work was done by email between meetings, the ARC met face to face on the following dates: December 20, 2010; February 16, 2011; February 28, 2011; April 1, 2011; April 26, 2011; December 19, 2011; February 14, 2012; October 26, 2012; May 14, 2013; June 19, 2013; October 28, 2013; September 5, 2014; October 17, 2014; and December 11, 2014. A significant portion of 2015 was taken up with finalizing the wording of the Copyright Regulations as well as drafting and finalizing a series of Frequently Asked Questions which will be posted on the AASUA website following the approval of the new Copyright Regulations. The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed on February 26, 2016. There will be a parallel approval process, involving both the AASUA membership as well as GFC/Board.

            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) To transform the existing free standing Division of Critical Care Medicine into a Department of Critical Care Medicine. The Division currently operates much like a Department, with a director who sits on the Faculty Evaluation Committee (for evaluation of its own members) and on the Faculty’s Chairs Committee. The Division has the responsibility for managing its own budget and teaching plan. We also recommend the current division director become chair of the department. The Impact of the Proposal is To strengthen the academic mission of the FOMD by removing organizational barriers to the further development of the academic critical care medicine.  A resource-neutral move that both formalizes the status quo and allows the unit to respond to scholarly developments in the academic field. It will also enhance recruitment and retention to compete against other Departments of Critical Care in the country. It will also create effective governance structures without requiring additional costs. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) The department will replace the free standing Division of Critical Care Medicine. Timeline/Implementation Date July 1, 2016 Estimated Cost Cost neutral Sources of Funding N/A Notes When this matter was considered by the GFC Academic Planning Committee, the committee requested that further details on library impact, organizational structure and budget be included for the consideration of General Faculties Council.

            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) The Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies will provide students with formal recognition of the leadership skills they have acquired through their coursework and through their experiences at the PLLC. The certificate will indicate to employers and graduate schools that the students have taken courses, have participated in co-curricular programs, and have had stretch experiences through which they have developed the ability to tackle the challenges of leadership in all aspects of their lives. It will be available to students in multiple Faculties. An Inaugural Class was recruited in 2015 and began their studies in September 2015 with the courses INT D 301 and INT D 306. If the Certificate is approved, these students and students in subsequent classes will be awarded the Certificate upon completion of the required coursework and the stretch experience. The Impact of the Proposal is PLLC will create opportunities for learning that will develop leadership skills and competences through enhanced formal and co-curricular programs, experiential learning, engagement with a wide range of leadership styles, commitment to ethical behaviour and social responsibility, and with access to excellence in mentorship. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) N/A Timeline/Implementation Date Upon approval Estimated Cost Funding to support the Certificate and related activities is in place, and no funding will be diverted from other University of Alberta sources. Sources of Funding The Peter Lougheed Leadership College is supported by dedicated Government of Alberta funding and by private donors. Notes It was noted by the GFC Academic Standards Committee that Faculty requirements may preclude certain students (such as those with practicum experiences, university athletes, etc)  from participating in the certificate due to the scheduling of courses; consideration will be given to  how these students can be accommodated in the future.  Also at the GFC Academic Standards Committee meeting, it was suggested that the last sentence of the course descriptions be revised to increase clarity including who is eligible to take the course and what Faculty is offering it. INT D 407 reflects this change and is currently in circulation in accordance with GFC Policy 37. The remaining three courses will follow GFC policy on course changes to reflect similar wording.  Alignment/Compliance Alignment with Guiding Documents Dare to Discover, Dare to Deliver. This program supports the vision of the University of Alberta in Dare to Deliver to build a university for the public good. The Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies will also help to realize the vision of the new Institutional Strategic Plan. It will help to build a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty and staff from Alberta, Canada and the world. These students will be able to experience diverse and rewarding learning opportunities, excel as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service. The Certificate will help students engage with communities across campuses, the province, Canada and the world to create reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, partnerships, and collaborations. Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment. The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC and the GFC ASC. (Sections 26(1), 60(1)(c) and (d)). 2. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee): “G. Certificates (All Faculties): Approval Route GFC delegated to ASC the authority to approve proposals for the establishment of and termination of credit and non-credit certificates, regardless of the proposing academic unit. Where additional funding and/or space is required to support the offering of the proposed certificate and/or if, in the opinion of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) (or delegate), the certificate requires Government approval, ASC would provide a recommendation on the (proposed) initiative to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC). (GFC 31 MAY 2005) (EXEC 12 JAN 2009)” 3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). 4. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas  such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 5. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.” 6. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). 7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy: “All current academic standing  regulations, including academic standing categories, University graduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be those prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the University Calendar.” 8. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All proposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing academic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the Administration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties will also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any proposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to  academic standing, including promotion and graduation. If the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to be in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate University governance process(es). In considering these proposals, governance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices. Normally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or its delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” 9. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee) “5. Agendas of General Faculties Council GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those agenda items appear on each GFC agenda. […] With respect to recommendations from … GFC committees [excluding APC], however, the role of the Executive Committee shall be to examine and debate the substance of reports or recommendations and to decide if an item is ready to be forwarded to the full governing body. The Executive Committee may decide to refer a proposal back to the originating body, to refer the proposal to another body or individual for study or review, or to take other action in order to ready a proposal for consideration by General Faculties Council.

            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) The Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies will provide students with formal recognition of the leadership skills they have acquired through their coursework and through their experiences at the PLLC. The certificate will indicate to employers and graduate schools that the students have taken courses, have participated in co-curricular programs, and have had stretch experiences through which they have developed the ability to tackle the challenges of leadership in all aspects of their lives. It will be available to students in multiple Faculties. An Inaugural Class was recruited in 2015 and began their studies in September 2015 with the courses INT D 301 and INT D 306. If the Certificate is approved, these students and students in subsequent classes will be awarded the Certificate upon completion of the required coursework and the stretch experience. The Impact of the Proposal is PLLC will create opportunities for learning that will develop leadership skills and competences through enhanced formal and co-curricular programs, experiential learning, engagement with a wide range of leadership styles, commitment to ethical behaviour and social responsibility, and with access to excellence in mentorship. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) N/A Timeline/Implementation Date Upon approval Estimated Cost Funding to support the Certificate and related activities is in place, and no funding will be diverted from other University of Alberta sources. Sources of Funding The Peter Lougheed Leadership College is supported by dedicated Government of Alberta funding and by private donors. Notes It was noted by the GFC Academic Standards Committee that Faculty requirements may preclude certain students (such as those with practicum experiences, university athletes, etc)  from participating in the certificate due to the scheduling of courses; consideration will be given to  how these students can be accommodated in the future.  Also at the GFC Academic Standards Committee meeting, it was suggested that the last sentence of the course descriptions be revised to increase clarity including who is eligible to take the course and what Faculty is offering it. INT D 407 reflects this change and is currently in circulation in accordance with GFC Policy 37. The remaining three courses will follow GFC policy on course changes to reflect similar wording.  Alignment/Compliance Alignment with Guiding Documents Dare to Discover, Dare to Deliver. This program supports the vision of the University of Alberta in Dare to Deliver to build a university for the public good. The Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies will also help to realize the vision of the new Institutional Strategic Plan. It will help to build a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty and staff from Alberta, Canada and the world. These students will be able to experience diverse and rewarding learning opportunities, excel as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service. The Certificate will help students engage with communities across campuses, the province, Canada and the world to create reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, partnerships, and collaborations. Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment. The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC and the GFC ASC. (Sections 26(1), 60(1)(c) and (d)). 2. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee): “G. Certificates (All Faculties): Approval Route GFC delegated to ASC the authority to approve proposals for the establishment of and termination of credit and non-credit certificates, regardless of the proposing academic unit. Where additional funding and/or space is required to support the offering of the proposed certificate and/or if, in the opinion of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) (or delegate), the certificate requires Government approval, ASC would provide a recommendation on the (proposed) initiative to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC). (GFC 31 MAY 2005) (EXEC 12 JAN 2009)” 3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). 4. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas  such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 5. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.” 6. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). 7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy: “All current academic standing  regulations, including academic standing categories, University graduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be those prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the University Calendar.” 8. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All proposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing academic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the Administration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties will also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any proposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to  academic standing, including promotion and graduation. If the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to be in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate University governance process(es). In considering these proposals, governance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices. Normally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or its delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” 9. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee) “5. Agendas of General Faculties Council GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those agenda items appear on each GFC agenda. […] With respect to recommendations from … GFC committees [excluding APC], however, the role of the Executive Committee shall be to examine and debate the substance of reports or recommendations and to decide if an item is ready to be forwarded to the full governing body.
