The proposed changes are supported by research undertaken by the Office of the Registrar. The Impact of the Proposal is It is anticipated that the proposed changes will have a positive impact on student success within the international student body. Research conducted by the Enrolment Management unit in the Office of the Registrar shows the correlation between a higher overall ELP score and student success in first year courses, as indicated by final GPA and/or course withdrawals.  As a result of the proposed changes, an increased number of applicants might enter their chosen faculty/program through the Bridging program. The number of International applications may decrease which may lead to a reduction in the number of students admitted. There may also be a positive reputational impact associated with more rigorous ELP requirements.

Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment (Sections 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic Standards Committee (GFC ASC).  2. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference: “B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, Term Work, Examinations, International Baccalaureate (IB), Advanced Placement (AP) iv. ASC provides advice or recommends to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) on proposals which involve substantial change to admission/transfer regulations or to academic standing regulations. v. ASC provides advice or recommends to APC on general University admission or  3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. These criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.)  The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 4. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure:  “PROCEDURE EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS  Following approval by GFC:  a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May  2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006).”  b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty. 5. GFC Academic Planning Committee Terms of Reference  “7. Admission, Transfer and Academic Standing a. To consider advice or recommendation from the GFC ASC on proposals for the establishment of or change to general University admission or transfer policies affecting students, including policies affecting Open Studies students, and to act for GFC in approving policies which in APC’s view are minor or routine; and to recommend to GFC on proposals involving major change b. To consider advice or recommendation from GFC ASC on proposals which involve substantial change to admission/transfer or to academic standing regulations.” 6. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference “GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those agenda items appear on each GFC agenda. […]  When recommendations are forwarded to General Faculties Council from APC, the role of the Executive shall be to decide the order in which items should be considered by GFC. The Executive Committee is responsible for providing general advice to the Chair about proposals being forwarded from APC to GFC.” Attachments  1.

In its summative form, teaching evaluation forms a basis for rewarding excellence, as well as the basis for withholding reward. b. Formative – Evaluation provides helpful feedback to teachers by identifying teaching strengths and weaknesses and, in so doing, giving guidance for the improvement or refinement of teaching skills. 2. Evaluation of teaching must be multifaceted. Multifaceted evaluation shall include the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction set out in Section 111.3 and other methods of assessing teaching designed within individual Faculties to respond to the particular conditions of that Faculty. Such assessments shall include one or more of the following: input from administrators, peers, self, undergraduate and graduate students, and alumni. 3. Recognizing that the evaluation of teaching at the University shall be multifaceted, Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) decisions concerning tenure, promotion or unsatisfactory teaching performance must be based on more than one indicator of the adequacy of teaching. 4. Assessment of teaching involving input from administrators, peers, self, alumni, or undergraduate and graduate students in addition to the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction should occur annually prior to tenure. For continuing faculty (ie, Categories A1.1, A1.5 and A1.6), such assessment will occur at least triennially.  5. The University shall continue to support University Teaching Services in its education programming which is focused on the development and improvement of teaching and learning and its efforts to enhance research in university teaching. 111.3 Universal Student Ratings of Instruction In recognition of the University's commitment to teaching, the General Faculties Council endorses a system of Universal Student Ratings of Instruction. This system, however, is only one part of the multi-faceted approach described in Section 111.2. The Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are administered electronically via a system known as the eUSRI system.   The Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are designed to provide a minimal university-wide base of information on student ratings to the  parties listed in this Section. With this purpose in mind, the General Faculties Council adopts the following policies: A. All Faculties will ensure that evaluation of all instructors and courses will take place each time a course is offered. The term ‘instructors’ is meant to include tenured professors, tenure-track professors, sessional instructors, clinical instructors, field supervisors and graduate teaching assistants with responsibilities for courses. […] D. The anonymity of student responses to the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction is of fundamental importance in maintaining student confidentiality and encouraging the free expression of views. Under normal circumstances, the anonymity of students will be protected. Universal Student Ratings of Instruction offer an avenue of feedback, including feedback critical of instructors. […] G. The numerical summaries for the ten Universal Student Ratings of Instruction questions will be reported to the instructor, the Chair, Director or Dean and students. […] I. All results given out to students, Chairs, Directors and Deans will have the following cautionary preface: Student questionnaires form an important part of evaluating teaching effectiveness but cannot be taken alone as a complete assessment of an instructor or course. Factors other than an instructor’s teaching ability may influence ratings. These factors include class size, class level, Faculty, time in class, required versus optional course, grade expectations, student GPA, gender, race, ethnicity, age of both students and instructors. […] J. Nothing in this section will prevent instructors from seeking other means of feedback from students during the term.” The full GFC Policy 111 Teaching and Learning and Teaching Evaluation is available at: http://www.gfcpolicymanual.ualberta.ca/111TeachingandLearningandTe\nach.aspx 5. University of Alberta Faculty Agreement July 2006 (incorporating June 2007 and July 2008 amendments) “13.06 The standards for evaluation of teaching performance shall be broadly based, including course content, course design and performance in the classroom. Such evaluation may take into account information such as statistical summaries of responses to student questionnaires, comprehensive reviews of student commentary; reviews by peers, reviews by administrative officials and reviews of teaching dossiers and other materials provided by the staff member.” Attachments (each to be numbered 1 - <>) 1.

The impact will be to have greater clarity for students, faculty and staff in the administration and conduct and outcomes of examinations in thesis-based programs. The Impact of the Proposal is The conduct of graduate examinations holds extremely high stakes for individual students and presents significant reputational risk for the faculty, program and institution. A major revision the Supervision and Structure of Examining Committees in the Graduate Program Manual was approved by FGSR Council in May 2012. Subsequently in May 2013 the authority for approval of supervisors, supervisory committees, external examiners and examining committees was delegated to the disciplinary Faculty or department. The changes to the Calendar governing examinations encompassing both sets of changes was approved by FGSR Council October 2013 and first appeared in the 2014-2015 Calendar.  A number of areas came to light that cause problems due to apparent contradictions, gaps and/or confusing language.  The FSGR Policy Review Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the Supervision and Examination regulations.  The resulting proposal addresses the organization and clarity of the policy as well as changes to policy. The significant policy changes include: • The chair of doctoral examinations cannot be an examiner to remove issues of bias.  • One supervisor of a supervisory team must meet the employment criteria of a UofA examiner. • Size limits for examination committees are set to prevent extraordinarily long examinations in light of current flexibility in supervisory committee composition and the need to fulfill examiner composition balance. • A revamped section on “Conduct of Thesis and Candidacy Exams” was added back to provide consistency across the academy. • Guidance was added to the outcome of “Conditional Pass” for  doctoral candidacy examinations to lessen the rates of students not meeting the conditions. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Revises Supervision and Examinations policy as found in the FGSR section of the Calendar. Timeline/Implementation Date Effective July 1, 2018. The changes will be published in the 2018-2019 Calendar. Estimated Cost and funding source n/a Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) Upon final approval, an email will be sent to all members of FGSR Council that includes all Associate Deans Graduate and Graduate Coordinators of graduate programs, as well as the Graduate Program administrators. There will be internal communication to front end FGSR staff. Supplementary Notes and context The GFC Academic Standards Committee discussed the parameters of who can chair candidacy and doctoral examinations. Members discussed the role of the chair and how the proposed changes would preserve neutrality; the importance of having chairs with experience supervising graduate students; and having chairs from outside of the department to accommodate small departments. The committee also provided comments on the requirement of a student to withdraw if no supervisor was available.

Over the past academic year FPER Faculty members, staff, students, alumni and stakeholders were given the opportunity to provide input on a new Faculty name. After a formal process Faculty Council endorsed the name Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation. The Impact of the Proposal is The new Faculty name better defines and describes the teaching, research and service activities of the Faculty. The new name will both define and differentiate the Faculty at the national and international level, thus helping to attract top quality students, faculty and staff. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Current name:  Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation. Timeline/Implementation Date Effective upon approval. Estimated Cost and funding source The estimated cost of name change is approximately $250,000, which includes costs related to signage inside and outside of all Faculty buildings on North and South Campus, the update of all Faculty-named media, marketing and promotional material, and well as a dedicated marketing and communication plan to promote the new name locally, provincially, nationally, and internationally. Funds to support the costs of the name change will come from the Faculty, the Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic), and the Office of the Vice President University Relations. Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) On final approval by GFC, the Marketing and Communication office in the Faculty will complete both a ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ launch of the new Faculty name. The soft launch will immediately begin using the new Faculty name on any item that allows for immediate alteration (i.e. email signatures, newly created Faculty documents, etc.). The soft launch will occur immediately following approval by GFC. The hard launch of the new Faculty name will take place when all of the marketing, media, promotional material and way-finding signage are prepared. Upon hard launch all references to the former Faculty name will be removed, and the former Faculty name will only be used in the historical context.

The unique-in-Canada inclusion of the term ‘sport’ in the faculty name will offer a point of differentiation on the international scene, whereas the replacement of the name Physical Education with Kinesiology aligns the offerings of the Faculty with our domestic competitors. The renaming of the Faculty will address Objective 6 of the Institution Plan, by developing a ‘brand platform’ that will enhance our reputation, image and identity. The renaming of the Faculty aligns the name/brand of the Faculty with its mission and mandate, which is to ‘create and share (sic) the best understandings and applications of physical activity, sport and recreation for the public good’ (Faculty Strategic Plan 2016-2021). Consistent and aligned with the Institutional plan, the renaming of the Faculty positions the Faculty to Recruit and enroll high quality students and increase the number of out-of-province and international students in the Faculty (aligns with Faculty Strategic Plan; Build). Additionally, the proposed name of the Faculty aligns with Engage under the Faculty Strategic Plan, which seeks to ‘increase and depend the understanding’ of the Faculty. http://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\n Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1.
