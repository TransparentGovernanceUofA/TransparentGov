            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Vice-President (Research) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) To clarify when the staff member owns copyright, and when the University owns copyright. The Impact of the Proposal is To update and revise the language in Article 10 related to copyright in the various academic collective agreements (APO Agreement, Faculty Agreement, FSO Agreement, Librarian Agreement, CAST Agreement, SOTS Agreement, TRAS Agreement). Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Article 10 in the various Academic Staff Agreements. Timeline/Implementation Date July 1, 2016 Estimated Cost N/A Sources of Funding N/A Notes The rules regarding copyright created by academic staff at the University are based on two documents; the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) and the collective agreements between the Board and the AASUA.   The PSLA states: Intellectual Property 68(1) Unless otherwise agreed to by the board, the ownership of any invention, work, information or material, regardless of form, including any patent, copyright, technological or industrial design process or trademark acquired or produced by an officer of the post-secondary institution or an employee of the board that results from or is connected with the officer’s or employee’s duties or employment vests in the board and may be made available to the public under conditions, on payment of fees or royalties or otherwise, as the board may determine. The collective agreements between the Board of Governors and AASUA have contained Copyright Regulations (as Articles and/or Appendices) since 1977.  Over the years, there has been a significant amount of confusion when the parties have attempted to interpret the Copyright Regulations as it is not clear from the language when the University would own copyright and when it would be owned by the staff member.  The generally accepted practice (although not strictly based on the language) has been to acknowledge that academic staff own the copyright in their teaching materials, but the University has some sort of limited license to use that material. In 2010, the University of Alberta and the AASUA agreed to form an “Agreement Review Committee” that would examine two aspects of intellectual property: a) copyright and b) the emerging issue of intellectual property that is not covered by patent or copyright practices.  The ARC that was created has focused solely on the first issue - copyright.  This ARC has been meeting regularly since and has developed proposed new Copyright Regulations which would replace the existing regulations in their entirety.  The ARC believes that the new language creates greater certainty as it relates to copyright ownership and use.   The key elements of the proposed new Regulations include: 1.    Clear ownership by academic staff of copyright in works they create as a result of or connected with their duties or employment. 2.    An immediate, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable and irrevocable license to the University to use these works for purposes related to its approved mandate. 3.    A more limited license to the University to use a staff member’s detailed teaching materials, for example if the staff member is unable or unavailable to deliver all or part of a course assigned to that staff member during that academic year. 4.    Ownership by the University of copyright of works created by a staff member in the course of performing administrative or management duties or activities.   5.     A clear statement that a staff member’s copyright in works created as part of a sponsored research agreement is governed by the terms of that agreement.  This gives the University the right to alter copyright ownership in a sponsored research agreement, the way it is currently able to be done for Patentable Intellectual Property. *It is important to note that the proposed Regulations deal with copyright that is created by a University of Alberta academic staff member in performing his employment duties.  It does not apply to the use by the University of copyright materials from other sources (textbooks, library books, online sources, etc).  There is a separate policy suite being drafted that deals with such issues.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA):  Alberta’s Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) gives the Board of Governors the authority to “develop, manage and operate, alone or in co-operation with any person or organization, programs, services and facilities for the educational or cultural advancement of the people of Alberta” (Section 60(1)).  Further, the Board of Governors “must consider the recommendations of the general faculties council, if any, on matters of academic import prior to providing for […] any other activities the board considers necessary or advantageous”  (Section 19(e)). 2.  Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA):  Section 26(1) states that, “[s]ubject to the authority of the board, a general faculties council is responsible for the academic affairs of the university and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, has the authority to […] (o) make recommendations to the board with respect to affiliation with other institutions, academic planning, campus planning, a building program, the budget, the regulation of residences and dining halls, procedures in respect of appointments, promotions, salaries, tenure and dismissals, and any other matters considered by the general faculties council to be of interest to the university […].” Further, the PSLA, states in Section 31(1) that “[t]he general faculties council has general supervision of student affairs at a university […].” 3.

The composition of the ARC’s membership has changed significantly over time; the Vice-President (Research) has been a member from the beginning, as has Geoffrey Rockwell (Department of Philosophy). They have provided important continuity to the discussions over the past six years. During 2010, before detailed discussions began, a review of the copyright regulations of some of the University’s peer institutions in Canada (McGill, UBC, University of Toronto) and the US (University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, Penn State) was carried out.  This provided important context for the discussion about possible changes to the University’s copyright regulations. While significant work was done by email between meetings, the ARC met face to face on the following dates: December 20, 2010; February 16, 2011; February 28, 2011; April 1, 2011; April 26, 2011; December 19, 2011; February 14, 2012; October 26, 2012; May 14, 2013; June 19, 2013; October 28, 2013; September 5, 2014; October 17, 2014; and December 11, 2014. A significant portion of 2015 was taken up with finalizing the wording of the Copyright Regulations as well as drafting and finalizing a series of Frequently Asked Questions which will be posted on the AASUA website following the approval of the new Copyright Regulations. The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed on February 26, 2016. There will be a parallel approval process, involving both the AASUA membership as well as GFC/Board.
