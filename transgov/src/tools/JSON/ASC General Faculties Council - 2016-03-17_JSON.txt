            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) As a residential, undergraduate, liberal arts and science faculty within the University of Alberta, the Augustana Campus places a special value on community-based education, international and outdoor educational experiences, undergraduate research and connections to rural and Aboriginal communities. In this context, the proposed new framework serves a dual-purpose vision: 1) to provide a rhythm for each academic year that advances experiential learning opportunities for students, connections between these opportunities and more traditional classroom work, and pedagogical innovation by faculty; 2) to create a clearer niche for Augustana and further differentiate the undergraduate student experience at Augustana from alternatives on North Campus or at other Alberta universities. The Impact of the Proposal is Apart from the above, the proposed Augustana Scheduling Initiative could potentially address:  -student workload issues: particularly important for student mental health challenges that are increasingly recognized as critical;  -faculty workload issues: particularly the need to accommodate research expectations in a predominantly teaching Faculty;  -greater flexibility in degree completion times: especially with the opportunity to complete a *3 course in September or January;  -development of a first-year seminar: understood across North America to be a “high-impact practice”, this mandatory “First Year Experience” course (proposed as AUIDS 101) will be a small seminar-\nstyle course for new students beginning studies at Augustana Faculty in the September or January 3-weeks course period;  -provide opportunities for first and second-year students to ‘sample’ courses: the 3-week course period means students commit less time to an interest that may or may not result in a change of major or minor, and give a ‘short-term’ opportunity to explore other subject areas;  -ability to accommodate students’ varying learning styles: this comes with the flexibility to present different learning methods within a 3 or 11 week course, as well as potentially over two or more of these components in the academic schedule;  Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) University Calendar 52.2, 52.3, 52.4, 55.4. Timeline/Implementation Date September 2017 Estimated Cost N/A Sources of Funding Existing resources.  There are no additional costs associated with the move to the 3-week/11-week calendar. A full load for students will continue to be 15 credits in the standard University of Alberta Fall term and 15 credits in the Winter term. Notes On May 4, 2015, Augustana Faculty Council passed the following motion: “THAT the Augustana Faculty implement, effective 2017-18, a new academic schedule with the Fall and Winter semesters each consisting of a 3-week term followed by an 11-week term and adopt a new timetable for the 11-week terms…and investigate the feasibility of an additional 3-week block term in the spring.” Alignment/Compliance Alignment with Guiding Documents Aligns with Dare to Deliver; Dare to Discover values:  -enrich the student experience; foster a collegial learning culture; promote interdisciplinary collaboration, enhancing opportunities to develop undergraduate inquiry and research skills; create learning opportunities for students and creative collaborations to address global challenges and initiatives; provide an intellectually superior educational environment for students; diverse, yet inclusive, dynamic collegial community that welcomes change. Aligns with Comprehensive Institutional Plan strategies, such as: -provide foundational support structures for students to create positive student experiences and engagement; ensure a high level of teaching quality; support programs and initiatives to help increase retention and completion rates; provide enhanced experiential learning opportunities; continue to create international opportunities for students; provide foundational support structures for students in order to create a nurturing environment that allows for positive student experience and engagement; continue development of innovative programming to meet the needs of students and the community; increase interdisciplinary, collaborative program and initiative development in order to offer students innovative and relevant educational opportunities.
