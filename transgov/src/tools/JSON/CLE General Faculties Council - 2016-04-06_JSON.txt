            "Presenter": " Lorne A Babiuk, Vice-President (Research) Subject Proposed New Copyright Regulations ",
            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Vice-President (Research) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) To clarify when the staff member owns copyright, and when the University owns copyright. The Impact of the Proposal is To update and revise the language in Article 10 related to copyright in the various academic collective agreements (APO Agreement, Faculty Agreement, FSO Agreement, Librarian Agreement, CAST Agreement, SOTS Agreement, TRAS Agreement). Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Article 10 in the various Academic Staff Agreements. Timeline/Implementation Date July 1, 2016 Estimated Cost N/A Sources of Funding N/A Notes The rules regarding copyright created by academic staff at the University are based on two documents; the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) and the collective agreements between the Board and the AASUA.   The PSLA states: Intellectual Property 68(1) Unless otherwise agreed to by the board, the ownership of any invention, work, information or material, regardless of form, including any patent, copyright, technological or industrial design process or trademark acquired or produced by an officer of the post-secondary institution or an employee of the board that results from or is connected with the officer’s or employee’s duties or employment vests in the board and may be made available to the public under conditions, on payment of fees or royalties or otherwise, as the board may determine. The collective agreements between the Board of Governors and AASUA have contained Copyright Regulations (as Articles and/or Appendices) since 1977.  Over the years, there has been a significant amount of confusion when the parties have attempted to interpret the Copyright Regulations as it is not clear from the language when the University would own copyright and when it would be owned by the staff member.  The generally accepted practice (although not strictly based on the language) has been to acknowledge that academic staff own the copyright in their teaching materials, but the University has some sort of limited license to use that material. In 2010, the University of Alberta and the AASUA agreed to form an “Agreement Review Committee” that would examine two aspects of intellectual property: a) copyright and b) the emerging issue of intellectual property that is not covered by patent or copyright practices.  The ARC that was created has focused solely on the first issue - copyright.  This ARC has been meeting regularly since and has developed proposed new Copyright Regulations which would replace the existing regulations in their entirety.  The ARC believes that the new language creates greater certainty as it relates to copyright ownership and use.   The key elements of the proposed new Regulations include: 1.    Clear ownership by academic staff of copyright in works they create as a result of or connected with their duties or employment. 2.    An immediate, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable and irrevocable license to the University to use these works for purposes related to its approved mandate. 3.    A more limited license to the University to use a staff member’s detailed teaching materials, for example if the staff member is unable or unavailable to deliver all or part of a course assigned to that staff member during that academic year. 4.    Ownership by the University of copyright of works created by a staff member in the course of performing administrative or management duties or activities.   5.     A clear statement that a staff member’s copyright in works created as part of a sponsored research agreement is governed by the terms of that agreement.  This gives the University the right to alter copyright ownership in a sponsored research agreement, the way it is currently able to be done for Patentable Intellectual Property. *It is important to note that the proposed Regulations deal with copyright that is created by a University of Alberta academic staff member in performing his employment duties.  It does not apply to the use by the University of copyright materials from other sources (textbooks, library books, online sources, etc).  There is a separate policy suite being drafted that deals with such issues. Alignment/Compliance Alignment with Guiding Documents Dare to Discover, Dare to Deliver, Comprehensive Institutional Plan,  academic collective agreements Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1.  Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA):  Alberta’s Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) gives the Board of Governors the authority to “develop, manage and operate, alone or in co-operation with any person or organization, programs, services and facilities for the educational or cultural advancement of the people of Alberta” (Section 60(1)).  Further, the Board of Governors “must consider the recommendations of the general faculties council, if any, on matters of academic import prior to providing for […] any other activities the board considers necessary or advantageous”  (Section 19(e)). 2.  Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA):  Section 26(1) states that, “[s]ubject to the authority of the board, a general faculties council is responsible for the academic affairs of the university and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, has the authority to […] (o) make recommendations to the board with respect to affiliation with other institutions, academic planning, campus planning, a building program, the budget, the regulation of residences and dining halls, procedures in respect of appointments, promotions, salaries, tenure and dismissals, and any other matters considered by the general faculties council to be of interest to the university […].” Further, the PSLA, states in Section 31(1) that “[t]he general faculties council has general supervision of student affairs at a university […].” 3. GFC Committee on the Learning Environment Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee) “The Committee on the Learning Environment is responsible for making recommendations concerning policy matters and action matters with respect to the following: […] b) To review and, as necessary, recommend to the GFC Academic Planning Committee or the GFC Executive Committee policies on teaching, learning, teaching evaluation, and recognition for teaching that promote the University’s Academic Plan. […] i) To consider any matter deemed by the GFC Committee on the Learning Environment to be within the purview of its general responsibility.” 4. GFC Academic Planning Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee) “The Academic Planning Committee (APC) is GFC’s senior committee dealing with academic, financial and planning issues. As such, it is not only responsible to GFC (or the Board) for the specific matters itemized below, but may also ask to consider or recommend to GFC on any academic issue, including: 1) those issues under the purview of other GFC committees, 2) any academic issue related to restructuring, 3) any research-related issue, or 4) issues linked to academic service units where those issues have a significant academic impact. In like manner, the President, Provost and Vice-President (academic) or other Vice-\nPresidents may refer any matter to APC for consideration or recommendation to GFC. APC is also responsible to GFC for promoting an optimal learning environment for students and excellence in teaching, research, and graduate studies. (GFC 29 SEP 2003)” 5. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee) “5. Agendas of General Faculties Council GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those agenda items appear on each GFC agenda.

The Committee shall also include any other matter delegated to the Committee by the Board. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing the Committee shall: a. review and approve initiatives related to the overall academic mission and related plans and policies of the University; b. review, provide feedback and approve teaching and research policies[.] […]” 7. Board Human Resources and Compensation Committee (3. Mandate of the Committee) “Except as provided in paragraph 4 and in the Board’s General Committee Terms of Reference, the Committee shall monitor, evaluate, advise and make decisions on behalf of the Board with respect to, and the Board delegates to the Committee responsibility and authority for, all policies and procedures affecting staff working condition sat the University and matters for collective bargaining and related service contracts. The Committee shall also consider any other matter delegated to the Committee by the Board. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing the Committee shall:  (a) consider and propose changes in collective agreements and confirm the mandate for negotiating committees with all bargaining units;[…] (g) review and approve material changes to personnel policies of the University that are outside the regular collective bargaining process and consider trends affecting such policies;” Routing (Include meeting dates) Participation: (parties who have seen the proposal and in what capacity) • Those who have been informed • Those who have been consulted • Those who are actively participating The Agreement Review Committee (ARC) on Copyright Regulations has met regularly since 2010, and both parties have also had numerous internal meetings.  The composition of the ARC’s membership has changed significantly over time; the Vice-President (Research) has been a member from the beginning, as has Geoffrey Rockwell (Department of Philosophy). They have provided important continuity to the discussions over the past six years. During 2010, before detailed discussions began, a review of the copyright regulations of some of the University’s peer institutions in Canada (McGill, UBC, University of Toronto) and the US (University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, Penn State) was carried out.  This provided important context for the discussion about possible changes to the University’s copyright regulations. While significant work was done by email between meetings, the ARC met face to face on the following dates: December 20, 2010; February 16, 2011; February 28, 2011; April 1, 2011; April 26, 2011; December 19, 2011; February 14, 2012; October 26, 2012; May 14, 2013; June 19, 2013; October 28, 2013; September 5, 2014; October 17, 2014; and December 11, 2014. A significant portion of 2015 was taken up with finalizing the wording of the Copyright Regulations as well as drafting and finalizing a series of Frequently Asked Questions which will be posted on the AASUA website following the approval of the new Copyright Regulations. The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed on February 26, 2016. There will be a parallel approval process, involving both the AASUA membership as well as GFC/Board.
