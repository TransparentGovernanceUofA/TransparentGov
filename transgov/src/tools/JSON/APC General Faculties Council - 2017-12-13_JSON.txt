Those degrees programs are for the Master of Arts, the Master of Science, the Master of Coaching, and the Doctor of Philosophy   The degree name change will align graduate degrees with our new faculty name (Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation).

The inclusion of the word Kinesiology is relevant most students in our faculty, as this name is the most recognized across Canada. The new name will both define and differentiate the degree at the national and international level, thus helping to attract top quality students, and help them to obtain employment by using a name that is more aligned with the field.
