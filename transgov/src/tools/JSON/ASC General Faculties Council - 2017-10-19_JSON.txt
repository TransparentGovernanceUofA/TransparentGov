UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 4.  UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006).” b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.” 5.  PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). 6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  “All current academic standing regulations, including academic standing categories, University graduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be those prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the University Calendar.” 7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All proposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing academic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the Administration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties will also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any proposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to academic standing, including promotion and graduation. If the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to be in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate University governance process(es).

            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) Amend and clarify wording regarding the following items: - The applicant pool for RADTH is being broadened to allow students with a GPA lower than 3.2 to apply to the program. The median will then be determined by the applicant pool. This change was added at the recommendation of Michele Moroz, Assistant Registrar.  - The removal of wording around the number of required credits to meet criteria of a full course load is being removed to ensure inclusion of students holding a full course load while being accommodated in any way.  - The purpose of adding the Academic Standing state of “Unsatisfactory Standing” is to allow for instances of a repeat year in specific circumstances. This aligns with other Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry professional programs that allow a repeat year.  - The purpose of changing the final decision maker regarding reexaminations from the Program Director to the RADTH Academic Standings Committee is to ensure that decisions such as this are vetted by a larger group rather than the discretion of one person. This change was also a recommendation from the program’s accreditation process, which was completed in 2016. - The removal of specific clinical site listings is to allow the program to grow and expand without need for specific changes to the sites listed.  The Impact of the Proposal is That the Calendar will reflect the updated wording and additions made within the admission and academic regulations for the Radiation Therapy Program.

To excel and achieve our full potential as an institution and as individuals, the University of Alberta will sustain a learning and research culture that inspires, supports, and champions high professional standards and outstanding achievements in basic and applied research and scholarship, creative activity, administration, and governance. Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1.

Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment (Section 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic Standards Committee (ASC). 2.

The Impact of the Proposal is The program changes will allow the Faculty of Nursing to deliver an enhanced undergraduate experience to our students.  Specific enhancements that will benefit students include: o Programs are constructed using concept-based teaching &\nlearning approaches, learner-centered education principles,\nrelationship-centered care and intentional clinical learning\nexperiences (deliberate practice)\no Major enhancements in amount and type of leadership courses\n(increasing from 1 leadership course to 4 courses), including a 9\ncredit senior clinical leadership practicum in the 4th year\no Specific focus on developing stress management and resiliency\nthrough the integration of formal evidence-based Mindfulness-\nBased Stress Reduction (MBSR) components and strategies for\nstudent success\no Clearer and closer connections between classroom, lab and\nclinical learning experiences (conceptually and timing of\nexperiences) – based on evidence and best practices\no Integration of a Community Service Learning course early in the\nprogram, and other opportunities to engage in clinical\nexperiences earlier in the programs (starting in 1st semester)\no Purposeful integration of healthcare informatics and technology\nthat reflects current and emerging practice in healthcare\no Inter-professional learning experiences embedded throughout the\nprogram in addition to a leadership course focused on the\napplication of Inter-professional healthcare competencies\no Integration of the Indigenous Health in Canada course – in\nresponse to the TRC recommendations for health disciplines\no Academic standing and admissions policies include a minimum\npass (C+) standard for key foundational courses that will ensure\nstudents have the knowledge necessary for success in higher\nlevel clinical courses\no Additional and enhanced clinical experiences (increased hours of\nclinical practice) as well as the use of a wider range of practice settings that more accurately reflect the current and future practice settings of Registered Nurses o Purposeful engagement with and integration of the programs of research of our faculty members ~ leveraging our strength as a top ranked research Faculty to enhance our undergraduate student experience Starting Fall of 2018, the Undergraduate Nursing Programs will offer the new courses and a new course sequence for all incoming students.  Because of the significant enhancements and clear student benefits, we have created a proposed cross-walk plan for students who entered our programs in the Fall of 2017 to move into year two of the new programs in the Fall of 2018 so that they can also have the benefits of the program changes for the remainder of their undergraduate education. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Timeline/Implementation Date Fall 2018 Estimated Cost and funding source N/A Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) A clear and comprehensive communication plan around this change for current students has been developed and is ready to be implemented upon approval of this motion. The communication plan includes face to face sessions for all current 1st year nursing students about the cross-\nwalk, including Q&A in October 2017; arranging for 1:1 meetings between students and the student advisor or the director of undergraduate programs for all students who have additional questions or specific issues (through Oct. and Nov., 2017). We also plan to provide written communication about the details of the program enhancements and the cross-walk plans. A YouTube presentation that summarizes the enhancements and frequently asked questions will be available to all students.  Once we have determined the number of students who may wish to opt-\nout of the cross-walk option, we will provide them with individual program maps and undertake the necessary scheduling and planning to ensure their course sequence can be delivered. We have already met with the RO in terms of planning and implementation of the cross-walk plan.  The majority of courses are a 1:1 replacement (equivalent course content and credits) and in these cases, the calendar provision for course changes applies.  In the case where there is a change in credit weighting and not direct equivalency, we would provide students the choice to opt-out of the new courses and complete the previous course versions (or equivalent)/old sequence. The faculty of nursing will continue with the development of course content, course outlines, schedules and course specific learning activities. Faculty members have been selected to act as development leads for each new course and we have begun development meetings. Our overall communication plan for informing and engaging with stakeholders (students, faculty, healthcare partners, educational partners and nursing organizations) will also continue to be implemented.

            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic)> The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) There are currently two graduate degrees offered in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture (HADCV), the thesis-based Master of Arts (MA) and the thesis-based PhD. These are offered through the Department of Art and Design in the Faculty of Arts. This proposal is to add a course-based MA in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture to our offerings. The Impact of the Proposal is The new degree will offer a flexible graduate degree option for students, artists, community members, and teachers who have completed a Bachelor’s degree in the history of art or a related discipline. It will also be of use to students who have completed other graduate programs, such as the Master of Fine Arts (MFA). Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) N/A Timeline/Implementation Date September 2019 Estimated Cost and funding source Resources which are currently being used to deliver courses to the thesis-based MA students will now be used to fund courses taken by both thesis and course-based MA students. This new option will bring costs down and more students will be served because the course-based MA students will be added to already existing courses taken by thesis-\nbased MA students. Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) Supplementary Notes and context The new degree will offer a flexible degree option for students, artists, community members, and teachers who have completed a Bachelor’s degree in the history of art or a related discipline. It will also be of use to students who have completed other graduate programs, such as the 1\nMaster of Fine Arts (MFA).  The degree is designed to allow completion in one year, although it may also be completed part time over a longer period of time. Except for the capstone, which will be available as independent study, it makes use of courses that are already in place and regularly offered. They will pay the standard course-based graduate tuition; there will be no extra costs. The course-based MA differs from the thesis-based MA (preparing for PhD work and research careers) in that it will be preparing students for professional and managerial careers in the arts.

These criteria may be defined in areas 3\nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 6. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference (Mandate): The Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) has determined that the proposed changes are substantial in nature. ASC’s terms of reference provide that “the term ‘substantial’ refers to proposals which involve or affect more than one Faculty or unit; are part of a proposal for a new program; are likely to have a financial impact; represent a definite departure from current policy; involve a quota; articulate a new academic concept\" (3.A.ii).

            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) The combined MScPT/PhD program brings together two programs to achieve efficiencies that help exceptional students seamlessly complete combined clinical and research studies. Two options for flow of the program are proposed – start in the PhD or start in the MScPT. The Impact of the Proposal is The physical therapy profession continues to lack PhD trained clinician-\nscientists to carry out clinically relevant research to advance the profession. Such individuals are essential for the profession to explore new and effective interventions for our clients, and maintain the quality of training for new clinicians at the universities. The implementation of the MScPT Entry-level Program in 2003 has further diminished the number of physical therapists entering research, partly because of the very long time frame of education (i.e., 4 years of undergraduate studies, 2.5 years PT professional training, 4-5 years of PhD training). We will address this issue by implementing an MScPT/PhD combined training program, in an effort to make it more attractive for highly promising individuals partly by reducing the total number of years required for such a qualification. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) n/a Timeline/Implementation Date Effective immediately upon final approval Estimated Cost and funding source There are no resource implications of this program because both programs already exist and are resourced. Students in the program will be assessed doctoral program fees for the entire program. Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) Supplementary Notes and context We expect to enroll a maximum of 2 new students each year. Students in the combined program will be included in the regular MScPT cohort – there will not be additional spots held for combined students. Students in 1\nthe program will be assessed PhD program fees, which is the same as the fees students enrolled in the MScSLP/PhD program are assessed. Students enrolled in the combined MScPT/PhD program will not have the option of transferring to the MScPT program or the PhD Rehabilitation Sciences program.

            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) The Department of Occupational Therapy updated the entrance requirements for the Master of Science degree in Occupational Therapy (MScOT) to: (1)  Communicate minimum scores for the English Language Requirement as per FGSR standards.  (2) Add an online situational judgment test (CASPer) to assess for non-cognitive skills and interpersonal characteristics that the Department of Occupational Therapy believes are important for students to be successful in the MScOT program and for graduates to be excellent occupational therapists. The CASPer results will complement the other tools that are used for screening applicants. In implementing CASPer, the Department is trying to further enhance fairness and objectivity in the selection process. The CASPer test is comprised of 12 sections of video and written scenarios. Following each scenario, applicants will be required to answer a set of probing questions under a time limit. Each response is graded by different raters, giving a robust and reliable view of personal and professional characteristics important to the MScOT program.  (3) Remove extraneous information to simplify this section of the calendar for applicants. The Impact of the Proposal is The introduction of an online situational judgment test to the entrance requirements of the MScOT program will enable the Department to more effectively screen applicants for non-cognitive skills deemed important for success in the program as well as the profession of occupational therapy.  The impact to applicants is the addition of an online test that comes with a minimal personal cost ($40) and limited time commitment (75-90 minutes). In order to complete the CASPer test, applicants will be responsible for securing access to a computer with audio capabilities, a webcam, and a reliable internet connection on a selected test date. The test can be taken practically anywhere that satisfies the aforementioned requirements. There is technical support available leading up to and at the time of the test and applicants are provided with several test date options to choose from.  Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Current admission requirements for the MSc in Occupational Therapy as found in the 2017-2018 Calendar. Timeline/Implementation Date For early implementation Spring term 2018 (to be published in the 2018-\n2019 Calendar) Estimated Cost and funding source No additional resources are required, and no additional fees will be charged to students. Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) An information package has been developed for the MScOT program admissions website that outlines the rationale for the online situational judgment test as well as instructions for its successful completion. Should the requested changes to the entrance requirements be approved before November 1, 2017, this content can be loaded to the website ahead of the 2018 admissions cycle for the MScOT program.

Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment (Section 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic Standards Committee (ASC). 2. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). 3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is 3\nbased on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar.

UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). b.
