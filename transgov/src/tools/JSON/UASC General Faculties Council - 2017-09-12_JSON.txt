To orient members to the committee’s mandate, terms of reference, procedures and to committee member roles and responsibilities. Timeline/Implementation Date N/A Supplementary Notes and context Engagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) Participation: (parties who have seen the proposal and in what capacity) Those who are actively participating: • GFC Undergraduate Awards and Scholarship Committee (UASC) Alignment/Compliance Alignment with Guiding Documents For the Public Good Objective 21 Encourage continuous improvement in administrative, governance, planning and stewardship systems, procedures, and policies that enable students, faculty, staff, and the institutions as a whole to achieve shared strategic goals. Report of the ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority (April 21, 2017) Orientation and Education “Orientation sessions should provide both high level governance information and detailed information on the responsibilities of members, voting protocol, seating, how meetings are structured, question period procedures, how members can report back to their constituencies, and how to get items on the agenda. It is important to recognize that committee orientation must be designed in light of the fact that those at-large members who do not sit on GFC may require additional attention. The ad hoc committee recommends that  orientation and orientation materials should be provided in a number of modes and formats, including stand-alone orientation workshops, briefings at meetings, and through widely available written and online materials. A GFC member handbook or guidebook would be an ideal reference tool. In light of the unique character of collegial academic governance, GFC members should be encouraged to use orientation sessions to meet and get to know their fellow members and create networks which can provide informal support and community building opportunities. The following recommendations focus on improving orientation to prepare GFC and committee members to be informed and active participants in academic governance. Recommendation: THAT a variety of orientation sessions be offered including a general orientation to governance (Governance 101), followed by orientations more specific to GFC and GFC standing committees, and follow up sessions through the year Recommendation: THAT the responsibilities of members be clearly outlined in a core GFC document” Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1.
