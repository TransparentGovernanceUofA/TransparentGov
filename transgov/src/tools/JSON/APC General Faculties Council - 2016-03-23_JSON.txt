            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) To establish a Supplemental Application Fee for the Doctor of Medicine program in the amount of $55 to cover costs of the application process within the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry. The Supplemental Application Fee of $55 will be collected from all applicants to the MD program, in addition to the University of Alberta undergraduate application fee (currently set at $125 for new applicants and $75 for current or former UAlberta students). The Impact of the Proposal is In addition to the University of Alberta undergraduate application for admission process, MD applicants must also complete a secondary application that is specific to the MD program. MD applicants are also subject to a specific set of additional requirements, including the CGPA, MCAT, personal activities and letters of reference.  There are about 1600 applicants each year and 480 are selected for interview (Multiple Mini Interview) after reviewing the previously noted requirements. Costs for the secondary medicine application including the MMI are incurred by the Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry. A supplemental application fee will allow the Faculty to recover a portion of its costs and sustain the current secondary application process.  Should this fee not be approved, the Faculty would be unable to cover these costs and the applicant experience could suffer as a result. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Creates a new supplemental application fee for the Doctor of Medicine program.

The Division currently operates much like a Department, with a director who sits on the Faculty Evaluation Committee (for evaluation of its own members) and on the Faculty’s Chairs Committee. The Division has the responsibility for managing its own budget and teaching plan. We also recommend the current division director become chair of the department. The Impact of the Proposal is A resource-neutral move that both formalizes the status quo and allows the unit to respond to scholarly developments in the academic field. It will also enhance recruitment and retention to compete against other Departments of Critical Care in the country. It will also create effective governance structures without requiring additional costs.
