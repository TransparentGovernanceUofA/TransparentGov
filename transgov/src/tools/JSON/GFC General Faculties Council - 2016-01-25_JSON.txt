",
            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Vice-President (Finance and Administration) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) In 2008, the University introduced the Office of Safe Disclosure and Human Rights as an intake office for issues arising under the Ethical Conduct and Safe Disclosure Policy. Organizationally, the office reports to the University Auditor to promote the independent, neutral, and advisory nature of the function. In 2010, the Helping Individuals at Risk Policy (HIAR) was introduced and an intake function was created to work in conjunction with the Office of Safe Disclosure and Human Rights (SDHR). The policy requires that annual reporting to General Faculties Council (GFC) and to the Board of Governors will occur after each year of operation. The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the activities of each office and to comment on trends and issues in these.  The Impact of the Proposal is To provide the University with an update on the activities of HIAR and SDHR and provide information on trends and strategies for dealing with them. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) N/A Timeline/Implementation Date N/A Estimated Cost N/A Sources of Funding N/A Notes N/A Alignment/Compliance Alignment with Guiding Documents Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and 1.

GFC Policy: The Helping Individuals at Risk and Safe Disclosure and Human Rights Annual Report is one of several reports from non-GFC committees/entities requested to provide an annual report to GFC.  3. GFC Terms of Reference (GFC Procedures/GFC Agendas/ Reports):  “Reports not requiring action by GFC will be discussed by the Executive Committee (with committee chairs in attendance) and placed on the GFC agenda for information. If a GFC member has a question about a report, or feels that the report should be discussed by GFC, the GFC member should notify the Secretary to GFC, in writing, two business days or more before GFC meets so that the committee chair can be invited to attend. Such reports will be discussed as the last of the standing items.” (Section 4.a.) Annual reports are made available to GFC online (GFC, February 24, 2003, Minute 14). 4.  Helping Individuals at Risk Policy (Section 9):  “The Case Team Coordinator will report annually to General Faculties Council and to the Board of Governors after each year of operation, subject to privacy concerns, with a formal review of the policy and procedure to occur after three years of operation.” 5.
