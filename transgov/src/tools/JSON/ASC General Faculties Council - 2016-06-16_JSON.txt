            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) Flexibility in pathways for learners is of increasing importance to offerings by post-secondary institutions.   To provide increased access to graduate education and flexibility for students, laddering is a potential mechanism to allow students to use courses taken in certificates and apply them toward pursuing and completing a master’s degree program. The Impact of the Proposal is Laddering is proposed as a means to reduce course requirements for the master’s degree program but the specifics of how laddered certificates are attributed to a degree are not yet established.  Laddering can allow for the majority of course-work to be completed through certificates where programs are aligned with a series of certificates.

OBJECTIVE: Expand access to and engagement in the University of Alberta for learners engaging in continuing and professional education programs, experiences, and lifelong learning activities. i. Strategy: Develop continuing and professional education programs that connect the knowledge-mobilization activities of the university’s faculty members to the needs of diverse learner communities. ii. Strategy: Create a wide range of opportunities, both in person and virtual, for broad, learning-centred programs for alumni and other communities of learners engaging in continuing and professional education. Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1.  Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs (section 26(1)).  Further, the Post-Secondary Learning Act (sections 60(1)(c) and (d)) gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting \"enrolment of students to take courses.\" The Board has delegated its authority over these areas to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic Standards Committee (GFC ASC) […] and has delegated certain of its powers to the GFC ASC. 2. GFC Academic Standards Committee (3. Mandate of the Committee)  “A. Definitions “i. “Routine and/or Editorial”  […] the terms “routine and/or editorial’ refers to proposals which do not involve or affect other Faculties or units; do not form part of a proposal for a new program; and which do not involve alteration of an existing quota or establishment of a new quota. Editorial or routine changes include any and all changes to the wording of an admissions or academic standing policy. ii. “Substantial”  […] the term “substantial” refers to proposals which involve or affect more than one Faculty or unit; are part of a proposal for a new program; are likely to have a financial impact; represent a definite departure from current policy; involve a quota; articulate a new academic concept.”  “B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, Term Work, Examinations, International Baccalaureate (IB), Advanced Placement (AP) i. All proposals from the Faculties or the Administration related to admission and transfer, to the academic standing of students, to institutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures and to term work policies and procedures are submitted to the Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) (or delegate) who chairs the GFC Academic Standards Committee. ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these proposals.  ii. ASC acts for GFC in approving routine and/or editorial changes to both admission/transfer policies and academic standing regulations” […] iv. ASC provides advice or recommends to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) on proposals which involve substantial change to admission/transfer regulations or to academic standing regulations. […] viii. ASC maintains a dialogue with the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) on major admission/transfer and academic standing issues.” 3. GFC Academic Planning Committee (3. Mandate of the Committee) “7. Admission, Transfer and Academic Standing a. To consider advice or recommendation from the GFC ASC on proposals for the establishment of or change to general University admission or transfer policies affecting students, including policies affecting Open Studies students, and to act for GFC in approving policies which in APC’s view are minor or routine; and to recommend to GFC on proposals involving major change. b.
