In the current wording a student is entitled to six years from the time of transfer to complete the course-based degree.

            "Description": "Details Responsibility Academic Standards Committee The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) To change Faculty of Arts re-examination policy to ensure that students who apply and are approved for re-examination have a realistic chance of passing the course after the re-examination has been written. The Impact of the Proposal is  Over the last few years, a significant portion of Arts students who apply for and are granted re-examination have little or no chance of success because their term grades in the re-examination course are also low, often because they have not completed the majority of their term assignments and exams.  The fee for a re-examination is approximately $150.00, and the Faculty considers it unethical to accept the money when the chance of success is non-existent. For example, a student with a failing mid-term grade worth 60% of the final grade has no hope of passing the course, even if an “A” is earned in a re-examination. To illustrate this, of 83 re-examination applications for Arts students approved in the last 4 ½ years, only 49 resulted in a passing grade.  By adding criteria related to course work completion and minimum term grade the success rate should rise. When revising our re-examination policy, we also reviewed similar policies from the Faculties of Business and Science.  These Faculties also include criteria which require students to provide evidence that a medical condition or compelling circumstance affected them at the time of writing the final exam.  When we reviewed Arts criteria, we chose not to require similar evidence as we wanted to allow for the possibility that students may just have “bad days” when writing exams.  We also requested feedback regarding the changes from the Faculty of Arts Undergraduate Student Services Office, and the Departments which are most commonly involved in the process for Arts students (Art & Design, Economics, Linguistics, Mathematics and Psychology). Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Introduces a Re-Examination policy specific to the Faculty of Arts.

The certificate will indicate to employers and graduate schools that the students have taken courses, have participated in co-curricular programs, and have had stretch experiences through which they have developed the ability to tackle the challenges of leadership in all aspects of their lives. It will be available to students in multiple Faculties. An Inaugural Class was recruited in 2015 and began their studies in September 2015 with the courses INT D 301 and INT D 306. If the Certificate is approved, these students and students in subsequent classes will be awarded the Certificate upon completion of the required coursework and the stretch experience. The Impact of the Proposal is PLLC will create opportunities for learning that will develop leadership skills and competences through enhanced formal and co-curricular programs, experiential learning, engagement with a wide range of leadership styles, commitment to ethical behaviour and social responsibility, and with access to excellence in mentorship.

Sources of Funding The Peter Lougheed Leadership College is supported by dedicated Government of Alberta funding and by private donors. Notes  Alignment/Compliance Alignment with Guiding Documents Dare to Discover, Dare to Deliver. This program supports the vision of the University of Alberta in Dare to Deliver to build a university for the public good. The Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies will also help to realize the vision of the new Institutional Strategic Plan. It will help to build a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty and staff from Alberta, Canada and the world. These students will be able to experience diverse and rewarding learning opportunities, excel as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service. The Certificate will help students engage with communities across campuses, the province, Canada and the world to create reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, partnerships, and collaborations. Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment. The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC and the GFC ASC. (Sections 26(1), 60(1)(c) and (d)). 2. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee): “G. Certificates (All Faculties): Approval Route GFC delegated to ASC the authority to approve proposals for the establishment of and termination of credit and non-credit certificates, regardless of the proposing academic unit. Where additional funding and/or space is required to support the offering of the proposed certificate and/or if, in the opinion of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) (or delegate), the certificate requires Government approval, ASC would provide a recommendation on the (proposed) initiative to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC). (GFC 31 MAY 2005) (EXEC 12 JAN 2009)” 3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). 4. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 5. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.” 6. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). 7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy: “All current academic standing  regulations, including academic standing categories, University graduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be those prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the University Calendar.” 8. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All proposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing academic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the Administration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties will also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any proposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to academic standing, including promotion and graduation. If the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to be in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate University governance process(es). In considering these proposals, governance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices. Normally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or its delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” 9. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee) “5. Agendas of General Faculties Council GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those agenda items appear on each GFC agenda. […] With respect to recommendations from … GFC committees [excluding APC], however, the role of the Executive Committee shall be to examine and debate the substance of reports or recommendations and to decide if an item is ready to be forwarded to the full governing body. The Executive Committee may decide to refer a proposal back to the originating body, to refer the proposal to another body or individual for study or review, or to take other action in order to ready a proposal for consideration by General Faculties Council. When the GFC Executive Committee forwards a proposal to GFC, it shall make a recommendation that GFC endorse; endorse with suggested amendments; not endorse; or forward the proposal with no comment.” 10. General Terms of Reference – Standing and Other Committees of General Faculties Council (GFC) “9. Delegations and Referrals Each standing committee has the power to refer or delegate specific matters under its authority to another GFC Standing Committee, to a Sub-Committee, or to an academic or administrative unit unless GFC expressly restricts referral or delegation or the other GFC Standing Committee, Sub-Committee or unit refuses to accept the referral or delegation.” 11. General Faculties Council Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee) “All powers and responsibilities under Section 26 of the PSLA not expressly delegated now or in the future shall be retained by General Faculties Council. The issues which remain with GFC or which would be referred by a Standing Committee to GFC would generally be in the nature of the following: • high level strategic and stewardship policy issues or matters of significant risk to the University; […] • those items which a Standing Committee considers to be of major strategic significance to or long-term impact on the University” Routing (Include meeting dates) Participation: (parties who have seen the proposal and in what capacity) • Those who have been informed • Those who have been Kim Campbell, Principal, and Martin Ferguson-Pell, Vice Principal, Peter Lougheed Leadership College The Academic Oversight Committee of PLLC – Nat Kav, Vice-Provost, Programs (Chair), Jim Bohun, ALES, Rebecca Nagel, Associate Dean, Arts, Glen Loppnow, Associate Dean, Science Joseph Doucet, Dean, Faculty of Business Undergraduate Studies Policy Committee (USPC), Faculty of Business. consulted • Those who are actively participating Proposal reviewed and approved February 23, 2016  Business Faculty Council.
