All proposals from the Faculties or the Administration related to admission and transfer, to the academic standing of students, to institutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures and to term work policies and procedures are submitted to the Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) (or delegate) who chairs the GFC Academic Standards Committee. ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these proposals. ii. ASC acts for GFC in approving routine and/or editorial changes to both admission/transfer policies and academic standing regulations” 3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 4.  UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE Item 3 - page 3\n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006).” b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.” 5.  PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). 6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  “All current academic standing regulations, including academic standing categories, University graduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be those prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the University Calendar.” 7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All proposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing academic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the Administration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties will also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any proposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to academic standing, including promotion and graduation. If the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to be in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate University governance process(es). In considering these proposals, governance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices. Normally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or its delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” Attachments  1.

Students may pursue the Certificate in Communicable Diseases by fulfilling the degree program requirements and by completing the certificate courses as part of their electives (*9 required). The Impact of the Proposal is Having the Certificate in Communicable Diseases will be an advantage for students seeking positions involving communicable disease research and/or control as it will make explicit their education in the field. Having the Certificate in Communicable Diseases will be an advantage for students seeking entrance into PhD programs in communicable disease research; it will make explicit their background in the field. This program will serve as a pilot for a potential MSc degree with specialization in Communicable Diseases. This pilot will allow us to assess the demand for Master’s level training in communicable diseases and also allow us to test the appropriateness of the courses. We expect 5-6 students to be enrolled in the Certificate in Communicable Diseases.  We expect minimal impact on other course offerings.

            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) To change admission requirements for NCA Special Students to reflect increased English Language Proficiency requirements. The proposed increases are to ensure that NCA students have sufficient English proficiency to be successful in class. The proposed changes were approved by the Law Faculty Council on November 8, 2016. Proposed Requirements are as follows: - TOEFL: Minimum score of 600 (paper-\nbased) or a total score of 100 with a score of at least 25 on each of the individual skills areas (internet-based) - IELTS (Academic): Minimum overall band score of 7.0 with at least 5 on each band - PTE (Academic): overall minimum score of 68 - EAP 550 course through the Faculty of Extension The Impact of the Proposal is NCA Special Students applying in future years would be required to achieve higher standards of English proficiency. It is anticipated that these new requirements will increase the likelihood of student success within the program. As NCA students are paying a substantial tuition cost, we would like to do what we can to ensure that they can successfully complete the program. With the improvements, it is anticipated that professors with special students in their class will have a reduced load, as they are will spend less time assisting them with language based challenges.

Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment. The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC and the GFC ASC (Academic Standards Committee). (Sections 26(1), 60(1)(c) and (d)).  2. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)).  3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.”  Item 7 - page 2\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\n4. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the GFC Academic Standards Committee For the Meeting of October 18, 2012 are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.”  5. GFC Academic Standards Committee  Terms of Reference (Mandate): “A. Definitions i. Routine and/or Editorial […] the term “routine and/or editorial” refers to proposals which do not involve or affect other Faculties or units; do not form part of a proposal for a new program; and which do not involve alternation of an existing quota or establishment of a new quota. Editorial or routine changes include any and all change to the wording or an admissions or academic standing policy.” “B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, Term Work, Examinations, […] i. All proposals from the Faculties or the Administration related to admission and transfer, to the academic standing of students, to institutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures and to term work policies and procedures are submitted to the Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) (or delegate) who chairs the GFC Academic Standards Committee. ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these proposals. ii.

            "Description": "Details Responsibility General Faculties Council The Purpose of the item is (please be specific) Members of the ad hoc Committee are touring GFC Standing Committees to solicit input, perspectives, and innovative ideas on moving Academic Governance into the future. Your ideas and suggestions will contribute to further discussions and consultation and inform the final report and recommendations which come forward to GFC in April.  This is your opportunity to contribute to the transformation of academic governance at the University of Alberta.  As members of this committee, you are uniquely placed to provide input and ideas to the ad hoc committee – the chance to make a difference is now. If you have additional ideas after the meeting, it is not too late; contact any member of the ad hoc committee to share your ideas. But ideally you will share with your committee colleagues during the meeting and allow the synergy of the group to build upon ideas. The following questions are provided to start the conversation and Committee members are encouraged to reflect on these, and any other issues you think of, and come prepared for a discussion of whether and what changes you’d like to see. •   Are there reasons for clarifying or changing the mandate of your committee? •   Can improvements be made to the operations of your committee, including how issues come to your attention and how you interact with other GFC committees? •   Is the membership and composition of the Standing Committee appropriate? •   Is there clarity on your Committee’s relationship to full GFC in terms of when issues and decisions should go to GFC and how to report back to GFC? •   Upon reflection, have there been times when an item has been approved with delegated authority that should have gone to full GFC?
