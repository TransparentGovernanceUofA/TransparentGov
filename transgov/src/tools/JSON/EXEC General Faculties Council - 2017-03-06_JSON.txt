            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President Academic The Purpose of the item is (please be specific) Following a GFC discussion in May, 2016, a decision was made to engage in a review and consultation of the state of and status of Scholarly Writing Supports (SWS) across the University of Alberta.  Wendy Rodgers, Deputy Provost, and André Costopoulos, Vice Provost and Dean of Students Co-Chaired the SWS Working Group.  The review involved face-to-face meetings, a series of town halls and invitations for online and email submissions from all sectors and members of the academy.  The data and information gathered was reviewed by the SWS Working Group and then collated into a report and recommendations to the Provost.  From August to December, 2016, Drs. Rodgers and Costopoulos participated in over 25 meetings, including six town halls. The meetings included all known existing writing support units from Faculties, centres, and other academic units. Over 80 online submissions and 6 email contributions were received and reviewed.   Regular updates on the progress of the review were provided to Deans’ Council, Vice Provosts’ Council, PEC-O, Chairs’ Council and General Faculties Council. The SWS Working Group achieved its overarching goal of submitting a report on the current state of scholarly writing support at the UofA, and a series of recommendations for the enhancement, optimization and coordination of all components and dimensions of writing support including service (tutoring), teaching and research.  Timeline/Implementation Date The Working Group’s recommendations will be considered by the Provost and Vice-President (Academic), and implementation will be guided by that office as well.  Supplementary Notes and context At the May 30, 2016 meeting of GFC, the Provost reported that the University was committed to providing no-cost writing services to students and that an examination of the model including consultation would occur. This issue arose on the floor of  GFC in response to a question from a member regarding the transition of services offered by the Centre for Writers in the Faculty of Arts to the portfolio of the Vice-\nProvost and Dean of Students.

The Impact of the Proposal is The proposed Policy indicates that, “The University recognizes the harm caused by a culture in which common attitudes, norms and practices tolerate, normalize, trivialize, excuse or outright condone sexual violence.” The Sexual Violence Policy suite affirms the University’s commitment to support survivors of sexual violence in a survivor driven process.  The Policy suite includes key definitions to educate all members of the university community.   Fundamental principles established in the policy suite include the importance of believing survivors when they disclose an experience of sexual violence and providing support, accommodations, interim measures, and information on filing a formal complaint.  In addition, the proposed policy indicates “The University takes seriously its responsibility to reduce sexual violence by fostering a culture of consent and support through education, training and policy.”  The impact will be an increasingly educated and informed community that can better handle disclosures and complaints of sexual violence. The Government of Alberta has made it clear that they expect every institution to produce a stand-alone policy on sexual violence.
