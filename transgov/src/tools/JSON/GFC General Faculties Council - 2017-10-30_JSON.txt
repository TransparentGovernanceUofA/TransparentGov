            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) The revisions are intended to clarify the policies, elaborate on procedures, and improve policies.  The impact will be to have greater clarity for students, faculty and staff in the administration and conduct and outcomes of examinations in thesis-based programs. The Impact of the Proposal is The conduct of graduate examinations holds extremely high stakes for individual students and presents significant reputational risk for the faculty, program and institution. A major revision the Supervision and Structure of Examining Committees in the Graduate Program Manual was approved by FGSR Council in May 2012. Subsequently in May 2013 the authority for approval of supervisors, supervisory committees, external examiners and examining committees was delegated to the disciplinary Faculty or department. The changes to the Calendar governing examinations encompassing both sets of changes was approved by FGSR Council October 2013 and first appeared in the 2014-2015 Calendar.  A number of areas came to light that cause problems due to apparent contradictions, gaps and/or confusing language.  The FSGR Policy Review Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the Supervision and Examination regulations.  The resulting proposal addresses the organization and clarity of the policy as well as changes to policy. The significant policy changes include: • The chair of doctoral examinations cannot be an examiner to\nremove issues of bias.\n• One supervisor of a supervisory team must meet the employment\ncriteria of a UofA examiner.\n• Size limits for examination committees are set to prevent\nextraordinarily long examinations in light of current flexibility in\nsupervisory committee composition and the need to fulfill\nexaminer composition balance.\n• A revamped section on “Conduct of Thesis and Candidacy\nExams” was added back to provide consistency across the\nacademy.\n• Guidance was added to the outcome of “Conditional Pass” for\ndoctoral candidacy examinations to lessen the rates of students not meeting the conditions. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Revises Supervision and Examinations policy as found in the FGSR section of the Calendar. Timeline/Implementation Date Effective July 1, 2018. The changes will be published in the 2018-2019 Calendar. Estimated Cost and funding source n/a Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) Upon final approval, an email will be sent to all members of FGSR Council that includes all Associate Deans Graduate and Graduate Coordinators of graduate programs, as well as the Graduate Program administrators. There will be internal communication to front end FGSR staff. Supplementary Notes and context The GFC Academic Standards Committee discussed the parameters of who can chair candidacy and doctoral examinations. Members discussed the role of the chair and how the proposed changes would preserve neutrality; the importance of having chairs with experience supervising graduate students; and having chairs from outside of the department to accommodate small departments.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs (Section 26(1)).  2. General Faculties Council Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee) “The issues which remain with GFC or which would be referred by a Standing Committee of GFC would generally be in the nature of the following: http://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\n• High level strategic and stewardship policy issues or matters of significant risk to the University”  3. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee) “5. Agendas of General Faculty Council GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those agenda items appear on each GFC agenda.  When ordering items, the GFC Executive Committee will be mindful of any matters that are of particular concern to students during March and April so that the student leaders who bring those items forward are able to address these items at GFC before their terms end. (EXEC 06 NOV 2006)  […]  With respect to recommendations from other bodies and other GFC committees, however, the role of the Executive Committee shall be to examine and debate the substance of reports or recommendations and to decide if an item is ready to be forwarded to the full governing body.  The Executive Committee may decide to refer a proposal back to the originating body, to refer the proposal to another body or individual for study or review, or to take other action in order to ready a proposal for consideration by General Faculties Council. When the GFC Executive Committee forwards a proposal to GFC, it shall make a recommendation that GFC endorse; endorse with suggested amendments; not endorse; or forward the proposal with no comment.” 4. GFC Committee on the Learning Environment (CLE) Terms of Reference (3.Mandate of the Committee):  “The Committee on the Learning Environment is a standing committee of the General Faculties Council that promotes an optimal learning environment in alignment with guiding documents of the University of Alberta.  The Committee on the Learning Environment is responsible for making recommendations concerning policy matters and action matters with respect to the following:  […] b) To review and, as necessary, recommend to the GFC Academic Planning Committee and GFC Executive Committee as relates to the development and implementation of policies on teaching, learning, teaching evaluation, and recognition for teaching that promote the University Academic Plan. c) To develop policies that promote ongoing assessment of teaching and learning through all Faculties and units. d) To nurture the development of innovative and creative teaching practices. e) To encourage the sharing and discussion of evidence about effective teaching and learning. f) To encourage the sharing and discussion of evidence about effective teaching, learning, and the services. g) To promote projects with relevant internal and external bodies that offer unique teaching and learning opportunities that would benefit the university community. h) To consider any matter deemed by the GFC Committee on the Learning Environment to be within the purview of its general responsibility. 5. GFC policy 111 Teaching and Learning and Teaching Evaluation “111.2 Teaching Evaluation  1. Evaluation of teaching at the University of Alberta serves two purposes: a. Summative – Evaluation provides a review and overview of an instructor’s teaching that is an essential element in promotion and tenure decisions. In its summative form, teaching evaluation forms a basis for rewarding excellence, as well as the basis for withholding reward. b. Formative – Evaluation provides helpful feedback to teachers by identifying teaching strengths and weaknesses and, in so doing, giving guidance for the improvement or refinement of teaching skills. 2. Evaluation of teaching must be multifaceted. Multifaceted evaluation shall include the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction set out in Section 111.3 and other methods of assessing teaching designed within individual Faculties to respond to the particular conditions of that Faculty. Such assessments shall include one or more of the following: input from administrators, peers, self, undergraduate and graduate students, and alumni. 3. Recognizing that the evaluation of teaching at the University shall be multifaceted, Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) decisions concerning tenure, promotion or unsatisfactory teaching performance must be based on more than one indicator of the adequacy of teaching. 4. Assessment of teaching involving input from administrators, peers, self, alumni, or undergraduate and graduate students in addition to the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction should occur annually prior to tenure. For continuing faculty (ie, Categories A1.1, A1.5 and A1.6), such assessment will occur at least triennially.  5. The University shall continue to support University Teaching Services in its education programming which is focused on the development and improvement of teaching and learning and its efforts to enhance research in university teaching. 111.3 Universal Student Ratings of Instruction In recognition of the University's commitment to teaching, the General Faculties Council endorses a system of Universal Student Ratings of Instruction. This system, however, is only one part of the multi-faceted approach described in Section 111.2. The Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are administered electronically via a system known as the eUSRI system.   The Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are designed to provide a minimal university-wide base of information on student ratings to the parties listed in this Section. With this purpose in mind, the General Faculties Council adopts the following policies: A. All Faculties will ensure that evaluation of all instructors and courses will take place each time a course is offered. The term ‘instructors’ is meant to include tenured professors, tenure-track professors, sessional instructors, clinical instructors, field supervisors and graduate teaching assistants with responsibilities for courses. […] D. The anonymity of student responses to the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction is of fundamental importance in maintaining student confidentiality and encouraging the free expression of views. Under normal circumstances, the anonymity of students will be protected. Universal Student Ratings of Instruction offer an avenue of feedback, including feedback critical of instructors. […] G. The numerical summaries for the ten Universal Student Ratings of Instruction questions will be reported to the instructor, the Chair, Director or Dean and students. […] I. All results given out to students, Chairs, Directors and Deans will have the following cautionary preface: Student questionnaires form an important part of evaluating teaching effectiveness but cannot be taken alone as a complete assessment of an instructor or course. Factors other than an instructor’s teaching ability may influence ratings. These factors include class size, class level, Faculty, time in class, required versus optional course, grade expectations, student GPA, gender, race, ethnicity, age of both students and instructors. […] J. Nothing in this section will prevent instructors from seeking other means of feedback from students during the term.” The full GFC Policy 111 Teaching and Learning and Teaching Evaluation is available at: http://www.gfcpolicymanual.ualberta.ca/111TeachingandLearningand\nTeach.aspx 5. University of Alberta Faculty Agreement July 2006 (incorporating June 2007 and July 2008 amendments) “13.06 The standards for evaluation of teaching performance shall be broadly based, including course content, course design and performance in the classroom. Such evaluation may take into account information such as statistical summaries of responses to student questionnaires, comprehensive reviews of student commentary; reviews by peers, reviews by administrative officials and reviews of teaching dossiers and other materials provided by the staff member.” Attachments (each to be numbered 1 - <>) 1.

Supplementary Notes and context The proposed terms of reference reflect a standard template that will be used for all GFC standing committees which has been designed to provide increased clarity on mandate, responsibilities, and delegated authority.  Further changes to the CLRC terms of reference include: 1. Reference to student residence codes has been removed in accordance with the Board’s delegation of creation and revision of these codes to Residence Services (February 2011).  2. The addition that preference be given for a Chair who has legal training, which the Committee has discussed and agreed upon previously (CLRC meetings of January 25 and May 25, 2017). 3. The addition of one elected academic staff member from GFC to the committee composition in accordance with principle 1 of the Principles for Standing Committee Composition: “Wherever possible, the majority of elected members of each standing committee should be drawn from the membership of GFC to provide tangible links between GFC and its standing committees and increase engagement of the greater GFC community.” 4. The voting status of ex-officio members has been revised to reflect their voting status in accordance with principle 3 of the Principles for Standing Committee Composition on GFC. 5.

Kyle Monda, Member, General Faculties Council Andrew Sharman, Vice-President (Facilities & Operations) Lesley Cormack, Dean, Faculty of Arts Re: Fine Arts Building Security The following are replies to questions asked by Kyle Monda regarding Security in the Fine Arts building (FAB).     How many break-ins, thefts, and assaults have occurred in the Fine Arts Building in 2017? ● There have been no break and enters reported to UAPS during 2017. ● There have been three thefts in 2017 (two regarding general property and one was a computer) ● There have been no assaults reported to UAPS during 2017. Does anyone respond when door alarms are triggered in the Fine Arts Building? ● The FAB has a hybrid alarm system. Some of the alarms are newer than others. The new installations are connected with the University Facilities and Operations (F&O) monitored alarm program while older alarms, which were installed by the faculty, are not monitored. ● UAPS responded to four monitored alarms during 2017. ● UAPS has also responded to two non-monitored alarms as a result of being called by FAB staff (noise complaints). Dedicated campus security staff patrol FAB & HUB now. Has any community consultation occurred regarding the increased presence of security staff in Faculty of Arts facilities? ● UAPS peace officers and security guards patrol all of our university campus locations (North, Campus St. Jean, South, Michener Park and Augustana). They are directed to different locations based on priority indicators. These directed activities are reviewed on a 24-hour basis and resources are deployed to locations that are demonstrating the highest need. ● There are no \"dedicated\" UAPS resources assigned to any one location. ● We have a new program that has been very successful since its initiation this September. We have created a security agent program which employs university students who are assigned to dedicated locations. These students receive formal training and are provided with a security  shirt and radio. Their role is to observe and report to our dispatch centre, who in turn will dispatch a UAPS peace officer or security guard as required. This service is on a contract basis and we have received positive feedback from areas who have requested the service. ● Residence Life and Real Estate Services have a contract with UAPS and a security agent is being deployed at HUB Mall after hours seven days a week. ● The security agent program has also been deployed to other student residence locations. ● Director Bill Spinks has previously spoken with Dean Cormack, Faculty of Arts, and followed up with an email offering information on the security agent program. Have any break-ins, thefts, or assaults occurred in the HUB Art & Design studios or North Power Plant Art & Design studios in 2017? If so, how many? ● No reports of any crimes have been reported to UAPS during 2017. Have Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CEPTD) audits ever been completed on the Fine Arts Building, the North Power Plant Art & Design studios, and HUB Art & Design studios? If so, were the recommendations implemented? ● The following audits have been conducted.  FAB 2015, Hub Mall 2016, Hub Mall 2013. These reports are on file and can be made available. ● Any recommendations made are not the responsibility of UAPS to implement. The CPTED is a service/report provided to the requester to consider and initiate any changes. Are any facilities safety upgrades planned for the Fine Arts Building, such as an updated access control system or CCTV systems? ● The scope of any upgrades would need to be determined jointly by the Faculty and F&O. Fine Arts have applied for video monitoring and UAPS has approved this request. Are any safety and security upgrades planned for the HUB Art & Design studios and North Power Plant Art & Design studios? ● The scope of any upgrades would need to be determined jointly by the Faculty and F&O. Residence Services have applied for video monitoring for the Hub Mall Vault and UAPS has approved this request.  What steps will the Faculty of Arts take to assure faculty, staff, and students working in Fine Arts facilities (such as the Fine Arts Building, North Power Plant studios, and HUB studios) that their safety is a priority? ● We cannot speak to what steps the Faculty of Arts will take, however, UAPS is available to assist. Gitta Kulczycki Vice-President (Finance & Administration) GENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL For the Meeting of October 30, 2017 Item 12.1Q Question from GFC Member Kyle Monda  Response from  Vice President Facilities & Operations Generally speaking, the U of A campus is a safe place to learn and work. That said, we all have a responsibility when it comes to safety and our greatest success in maintaining a safe environment for everyone comes from each of us taking small steps to thwart undesired behaviour.  As a matter of best practice, consideration of access control or video monitoring is based on a number of factors including risk assessments and security standards applied across the entirety of the university. Q. Are any facilities safety upgrades planned for the Fine Arts Building, such as an updated access control system or CCTV systems? R. We have received a proposal to implement CCTV upgrades for the Fine Arts Building and are currently costing out the project. Q. Are any safety and security upgrades planned for the HUB Art & Design studios and North Power Plant Art & Design studios? R. We are also aware of proposed upgrades for the HUB Art & Design Studios and are currently consulting with the Faculty as to how we can most effectively achieve the desired level of security. https://www.ualberta.ca/protective-services/information-safety\nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL For the Meeting of October 30, 2017 Item 12.1R Question: What steps will the Faculty of Arts take to assure faculty, staff, and students working in Fine Arts facilities (such as the Fine Arts Building, North Power Plant studios, and HUB studios) that their safety is a priority? Response: from Dean of Arts After a rash of incidents in the Fine Arts Building (FAB) in September, Dean Lesley Cormack and her team met with the Director of UAPS in early October to discuss the ongoing security issues and concerns. At this meeting, several issues were discussed, including speed of response and appropriate security measures.  Clarity was provided by UAPS as to when campus security versus the Edmonton Police Services (EPS) should be called in regards to security incidents. A memo clarifying the process was sent on October 18 to all departments, both in FAB and in all other Arts buildings. Questions were also raised about the communication of serious incidents in the building. UAPS and Central Marketing and Communications are currently developing communication protocols which will be shared when complete. In addition to the customary safety reminders from the departments to their staff, instructors and students, the Faculty is pursuing further measures identified through the 2015 Crime Prevention through Environmental Design Security Survey (CPTED) report for FAB. These measures include: •       Installation of video monitoring at the major entrances to all floors and entrances to swipe access areas. Arts is currently waiting for a quote from F&O for the cost of this video monitoring system. •       Review of building hours and access to the building through additional use of swipe cards •       Renovating and refurbishing the lower main floor of FAB to attract more student and staff into the area and make unwanted users feel that they do not belong in a well-maintained and well-defined space •       Installing physical barriers in specific stairwells to prevent unauthorized access to the stairs leading up to the roof Security issues due to the building’s proximity to the LRT station and as a through-way to other buildings remain a challenge but the safety of our students and staff are of utmost importance. We continue to work closely with Protective Services and engage with the departments in regards to future discussions and decisions to enhance the security of FAB  In regards to the HUB studio spaces, we are not aware of specific incidences but we are aware of building maintenance issues that are causing security concerns that needs to be addressed.

Kyle Monda, Member, General Faculties Council Andrew Sharman, Vice-President (Facilities & Operations) Lesley Cormack, Dean, Faculty of Arts Re: Fine Arts Building Security The following are replies to questions asked by Kyle Monda regarding Security in the Fine Arts building (FAB).     How many break-ins, thefts, and assaults have occurred in the Fine Arts Building in 2017? ● There have been no break and enters reported to UAPS during 2017. ● There have been three thefts in 2017 (two regarding general property and one was a computer) ● There have been no assaults reported to UAPS during 2017. Does anyone respond when door alarms are triggered in the Fine Arts Building? ● The FAB has a hybrid alarm system. Some of the alarms are newer than others. The new installations are connected with the University Facilities and Operations (F&O) monitored alarm program while older alarms, which were installed by the faculty, are not monitored. ● UAPS responded to four monitored alarms during 2017. ● UAPS has also responded to two non-monitored alarms as a result of being called by FAB staff (noise complaints). Dedicated campus security staff patrol FAB & HUB now. Has any community consultation occurred regarding the increased presence of security staff in Faculty of Arts facilities? ● UAPS peace officers and security guards patrol all of our university campus locations (North, Campus St. Jean, South, Michener Park and Augustana). They are directed to different locations based on priority indicators. These directed activities are reviewed on a 24-hour basis and resources are deployed to locations that are demonstrating the highest need. ● There are no \"dedicated\" UAPS resources assigned to any one location. ● We have a new program that has been very successful since its initiation this September. We have created a security agent program which employs university students who are assigned to dedicated locations. These students receive formal training and are provided with a security  shirt and radio. Their role is to observe and report to our dispatch centre, who in turn will dispatch a UAPS peace officer or security guard as required. This service is on a contract basis and we have received positive feedback from areas who have requested the service. ● Residence Life and Real Estate Services have a contract with UAPS and a security agent is being deployed at HUB Mall after hours seven days a week. ● The security agent program has also been deployed to other student residence locations. ● Director Bill Spinks has previously spoken with Dean Cormack, Faculty of Arts, and followed up with an email offering information on the security agent program. Have any break-ins, thefts, or assaults occurred in the HUB Art & Design studios or North Power Plant Art & Design studios in 2017? If so, how many? ● No reports of any crimes have been reported to UAPS during 2017. Have Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CEPTD) audits ever been completed on the Fine Arts Building, the North Power Plant Art & Design studios, and HUB Art & Design studios? If so, were the recommendations implemented? ● The following audits have been conducted.  FAB 2015, Hub Mall 2016, Hub Mall 2013. These reports are on file and can be made available. ● Any recommendations made are not the responsibility of UAPS to implement. The CPTED is a service/report provided to the requester to consider and initiate any changes. Are any facilities safety upgrades planned for the Fine Arts Building, such as an updated access control system or CCTV systems? ● The scope of any upgrades would need to be determined jointly by the Faculty and F&O. Fine Arts have applied for video monitoring and UAPS has approved this request. Are any safety and security upgrades planned for the HUB Art & Design studios and North Power Plant Art & Design studios? ● The scope of any upgrades would need to be determined jointly by the Faculty and F&O. Residence Services have applied for video monitoring for the Hub Mall Vault and UAPS has approved this request.  What steps will the Faculty of Arts take to assure faculty, staff, and students working in Fine Arts facilities (such as the Fine Arts Building, North Power Plant studios, and HUB studios) that their safety is a priority? ● We cannot speak to what steps the Faculty of Arts will take, however, UAPS is available to assist. Gitta Kulczycki Vice-President (Finance & Administration) GENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL For the Meeting of October 30, 2017 Item 12.1Q Question from GFC Member Kyle Monda  Response from  Vice President Facilities & Operations Generally speaking, the U of A campus is a safe place to learn and work. That said, we all have a responsibility when it comes to safety and our greatest success in maintaining a safe environment for everyone comes from each of us taking small steps to thwart undesired behaviour.  As a matter of best practice, consideration of access control or video monitoring is based on a number of factors including risk assessments and security standards applied across the entirety of the university. Q. Are any facilities safety upgrades planned for the Fine Arts Building, such as an updated access control system or CCTV systems? R. We have received a proposal to implement CCTV upgrades for the Fine Arts Building and are currently costing out the project. Q. Are any safety and security upgrades planned for the HUB Art & Design studios and North Power Plant Art & Design studios? R. We are also aware of proposed upgrades for the HUB Art & Design Studios and are currently consulting with the Faculty as to how we can most effectively achieve the desired level of security. https://www.ualberta.ca/protective-services/information-safety\nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL For the Meeting of October 30, 2017 Item 12.1R Question: What steps will the Faculty of Arts take to assure faculty, staff, and students working in Fine Arts facilities (such as the Fine Arts Building, North Power Plant studios, and HUB studios) that their safety is a priority? Response: from Dean of Arts After a rash of incidents in the Fine Arts Building (FAB) in September, Dean Lesley Cormack and her team met with the Director of UAPS in early October to discuss the ongoing security issues and concerns. At this meeting, several issues were discussed, including speed of response and appropriate security measures.  Clarity was provided by UAPS as to when campus security versus the Edmonton Police Services (EPS) should be called in regards to security incidents. A memo clarifying the process was sent on October 18 to all departments, both in FAB and in all other Arts buildings. Questions were also raised about the communication of serious incidents in the building. UAPS and Central Marketing and Communications are currently developing communication protocols which will be shared when complete. In addition to the customary safety reminders from the departments to their staff, instructors and students, the Faculty is pursuing further measures identified through the 2015 Crime Prevention through Environmental Design Security Survey (CPTED) report for FAB. These measures include: •       Installation of video monitoring at the major entrances to all floors and entrances to swipe access areas. Arts is currently waiting for a quote from F&O for the cost of this video monitoring system. •       Review of building hours and access to the building through additional use of swipe cards •       Renovating and refurbishing the lower main floor of FAB to attract more student and staff into the area and make unwanted users feel that they do not belong in a well-maintained and well-defined space •       Installing physical barriers in specific stairwells to prevent unauthorized access to the stairs leading up to the roof Security issues due to the building’s proximity to the LRT station and as a through-way to other buildings remain a challenge but the safety of our students and staff are of utmost importance. We continue to work closely with Protective Services and engage with the departments in regards to future discussions and decisions to enhance the security of FAB  In regards to the HUB studio spaces, we are not aware of specific incidences but we are aware of building maintenance issues that are causing security concerns that needs to be addressed.
