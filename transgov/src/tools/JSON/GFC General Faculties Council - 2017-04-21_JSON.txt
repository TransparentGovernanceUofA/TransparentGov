Any related compensation matters would be dealt with at comprehensive bargaining. Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) AASUA Town Hall Faculty and Staff Relations Information Sessions Supplementary Notes and context In April, 2014, the Board provided Administration with a mandate to develop an academic performance evaluation and career progression model which would demonstrate the University’s commitment to a teaching-intensive career path within the CAS:T Agreement. Furthermore, in order to address a key concern of the CAS:T constituency, the mandate provided the ability to establish greater position security, by adopting a “contingent” appointment option for CAS:T Agreement staff members, and a range of appointment options more in keeping with the work done and working conditions experienced by CAS:T staff.

            "Description": "Details Responsibility David Turpin, President and Vice-Chancellor, and Chair, GFC The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) There has been a great deal of work done over the last several months leading up to this point. The work is reflected in the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority and has focused on GFC’s mission, which is to act on its responsibility for the academic affairs of the university within a framework structured by the principles of collegial governance.  Reforming academic governance required clear principles and guidelines regarding the responsibilities of GFC members, the delegation of powers, the composition of GFC committees, and the procedural rules for meetings of GFC and its committees. Four documents were developed, for immediate approval by GFC. These documents are intended to guide the implementation of the committee’s recommendations, including revisions to standing committee terms of reference, and also serve as the basis for future efforts to evaluate and improve academic governance at the University of Alberta. The four documents to be presented for approval address the following matters:  • Principles for  Delegation of Authority • Principles for Standing Committee Composition • Roles and Responsibilities of Members • Meeting Procedural Rules  GFC is asked to endorse and approve in principle the oversight, work and implementation of the recommendations as set forth in the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority.  Endorsement and approval in principle is important because ultimately it means that GFC and committee members will be working on the governing documents – the members will be doing this work. In addition, to ensure that the recommendations in the report will be completed, and to facilitate a smooth transition, as suggested in the report, GFC Executive Committee will oversee and facilitate the implementation of the recommendations on or before April 2019.  The Impact of the Proposal is The approval of these guiding documents will inform future work for the academic governing body and are critical foundational documents. The Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority presents recommendations for academic governance reform and sets forth a plan for how members can continue the work and be engaged participants in the academic governance process.   The endorsement and approval in principle of the recommendations presented in the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority will set the course for the ongoing renewal of academic governance, give oversight of this process to GFC Executive, and provide implementation timelines for renewal.  The endorsement and approval in principle of the draft GFC Standing Committee Terms of Reference will enable further work on these terms over the timelines outlined.  The recommendation of a transition process will ensure the work initiated by the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority will be completed on or before April 2019. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) The GFC Roles and Responsibilities of Members and GFC Meeting Procedural Rules revise elements of the GFC Terms of Reference and the General Terms of Reference for GFC Standing Committees.  Once approved, the revised documents are clear and consistent and will form part of the overall governing documents.   Timeline/Implementation Date The guiding documents will take effect upon approval at GFC on April 21, 2017 and be used to guide implementation of the recommendations of the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority along with any future renewal of academic governance. The implementation of the recommendations presented in the report will be carried out as per the timelines offered in the report. The draft GFC Standing Committee Terms of Reference will replace the current Terms of Reference upon their final approval by GFC as per the timelines outlined. Estimated Cost and funding source To be determined.  Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) Upon approval at GFC, the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority will proceed to the implementation phase.  Upon approval by GFC, a transition will be established to continue this work and conclude no later than April 2019. Supplementary Notes and context GFC established Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority in September 26, 2016 ‘to draft revised Terms of Reference of GFC and all GFC Standing Committees, updating delegated authorities for recommendation to GFC by April 30, 2017” and approved the tasks outlined in the committee’s terms of reference.  The committee has met bi-weekly since the beginning of October to understand the issues and develop appropriate recommendations to address them.
