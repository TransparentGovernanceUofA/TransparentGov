This proposal stems from that motion and seeks the creation of a new course designator, PSSTC, in the Centre collegial de l’Alberta, Faculté Saint-Jean, starting in Fall 2017.

However, close examination determined all 3 were actually Undeclared majors who were reported as Musical Arts majors due to the reporting requirements stipulated by the Government of Alberta.  The last reported Musical Arts major was in 2010.
