The Impact of the Proposal is At its April 19, 2017 regular meeting, APC approved, with delegated authority from GFC, the proposal to create a new Préposé aux soins de santé (PSS) – Health Care Aide (HCA) certificate program to take effect in September 2017.   This proposal stems from that motion and seeks the creation of a new course designator, PSSTC, in the Centre collegial de l’Alberta, Faculté Saint-Jean, starting in Fall 2017.  This course designation does not exist. As the PSS – HCA program proposal moves forward, not taking action would mean that students cannot enroll in courses for the PSS-HCA program.
