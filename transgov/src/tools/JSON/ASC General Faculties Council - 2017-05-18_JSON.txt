Strategy: Develop and implement an undergraduate and graduate recruitment and retention strategy to attract Indigenous students from across Alberta and Canada. Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs Section 26(1)).  2. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)).  3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.)  The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar.  The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.”  4. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure:  “PROCEDURE   1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS  Following approval by GFC:  a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar).  For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006).”  b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the  approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.”  5.

ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these proposals.  ii. ASC acts for GFC in approving routine and/or editorial changes to both admission/transfer policies […] iv. ASC provides advice or recommends to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) on proposals which involve substantial change to admission/transfer regulations or to academic standing regulations. 6. GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) Terms of Reference (Mandate): Admission, Transfer and Academic Standing  a. To consider advice or recommendation from the GFC ASC on proposals for the establishment of or change to general University admission or transfer policies affecting students, including policies affecting Open Studies students, and to act for GFC in approving policies which in APC's view are minor or routine; and to recommend to GFC on proposals involving major change  b.

            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) The revisions are intended to clarify the policies, elaborate on procedures, and improve policies.  The impact will be to have greater clarity for students, faculty and staff in the administration and conduct and outcomes of examinations in thesis-based programs. The Impact of the Proposal is The conduct of graduate examinations holds extremely high stakes for individual students and presents significant reputational risk for the faculty, program and institution. A major revision the Supervision and Structure of Examining Committees in the Graduate Program Manual was approved by FGSR Council in May 2012. Subsequently in May 2013 the authority for approval of supervisors, supervisory committees, external examiners and examining committees was delegated to the disciplinary department/Faculty of the program and the change to the Calendar governing examinations was approved by FGSR Council October 2013 appearing in the 2014-2015 Calendar.  A number of areas have come to light that have caused problems due to apparent contradictions, gaps and/or confusing language.  The FSGR Policy Review Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the Supervision and Examination regulations.  The resulting proposal addresses the organization and clarity of the policy as well as changes to policy as follow: • The chair of doctoral examinations cannot be an examiner to remove issues of bias that have arisen • One supervisor of a supervisory team must meet the employment criteria of a UofA examiner • Size limits for examination committees are set to prevent extraordinarily long examinations in light of current flexibility in supervisory committee composition and the need to fulfill examiner composition balance. • A revamped section on “Conduct of Thesis and Candidacy Exams” was added back to provide consistency across the academy. • Guidance added for outcome of “Conditional Pass” for doctoral candidacy exam to lessen the rates of students not meeting the conditions.
