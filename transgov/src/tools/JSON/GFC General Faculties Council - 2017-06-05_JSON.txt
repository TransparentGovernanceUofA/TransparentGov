            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) Approval of the (proposed) Termination of the Augustana BMus Liturgical Arts Major and the BMus Musical Arts Major The Impact of the Proposal is No impact.  There have been no students registered in either major since the University of Alberta began officially maintaining the Augustana Faculty student records in September 2006.    Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Will require removal of the programs and all references to the programs from the University Calendar: Augustana Faculty Bachelor of Music section. Timeline/Implementation Date Termination to take effect upon approval. Program will be removed from the 2018-2019 University Calendar. Estimated Cost and funding source N/A Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) Formal Calendar change will be implemented upon approval.  After approval by the Board of Governors, the proposal will be submitted to the Ministry of Advanced Education for approval.  Supplementary Notes and context Since September 2006, no students have been registered in either of the Liturgical Arts or Musical Arts BMus majors offered by Augustana Faculty. Official student reporting by the University to the Government of Alberta does show 3 students registered in the Musical Arts Major from 2006-\n2016.  However, close examination determined all 3 were actually Undeclared majors who were reported as Musical Arts majors due to the reporting requirements stipulated by the Government of Alberta.  The last reported Musical Arts major was in 2010. Given the lack of registrations in these majors, consultation with the Office of the Provost and Vice President (Academic) and the Government of Alberta recommended moving forward with the termination of these majors, without a period of suspension.
