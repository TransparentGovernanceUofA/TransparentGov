            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic)> The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) There are currently two graduate degrees offered in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture (HADCV), the thesis-based Master of Arts (MA) and the thesis-based PhD. These are offered through the Department of Art and Design in the Faculty of Arts. This proposal is to add a course-based MA in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture to our offerings. The Impact of the Proposal is The new degree will offer a flexible graduate degree option for students, artists, community members, and teachers who have completed a Bachelor’s degree in the history of art or a related discipline. It will also be of use to students who have completed other graduate programs, such as the Master of Fine Arts (MFA). Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) N/A Timeline/Implementation Date September 2019 Estimated Cost and funding source Resources which are currently being used to deliver courses to the thesis-based MA students will now be used to fund courses taken by both thesis and course-based MA students. This new option will bring costs down and more students will be served because the course-based MA students will be added to already existing courses taken by thesis-\nbased MA students. Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) Supplementary Notes and context The new degree will offer a flexible degree option for students, artists, community members, and teachers who have completed a Bachelor’s degree in the history of art or a related discipline. It will also be of use to students who have completed other graduate programs, such as the Master of Fine Arts (MFA).  The degree is designed to allow completion in one year, although it may also be completed part time over a longer period of time. Except for the capstone, which will be available as independent study, it makes use of courses that are already in place and regularly offered. They will pay the standard course-based graduate tuition; there will be no extra costs. The course-based MA differs from the thesis-based MA (preparing for PhD work and research careers) in that it will be preparing students for professional and managerial careers in the arts.

OBJECTIVE 14: Inspire, model, and support excellence in teaching and learning. i) Foster, encourage, and support innovation and experimentation in curriculum development, teaching, and learning at the individual, unit, and institutional levels. ENGAGE GOAL: Engage communities across our campuses, city and region, province, nation and the world to create reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, partnerships, and collaborations.   Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment (Section 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic Standards Committee (ASC). 2. PSLA: GFC may make recommendations to the Board of Governors on a number of matters including the budget and academic planning (Section 26(1)(o)). GFC delegates its power to recommend to the Board on the budget and on new or revised academic programs to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC). 3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). 4. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine the programs of study for which the faculty is established” (Section 29(1)(a)); to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” (Section 29(1)(c)); and to “determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). 5. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. These criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 6. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference (Mandate): The Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) has determined that the proposed changes are substantial in nature. ASC’s terms of reference provide that “the term ‘substantial’ refers to proposals which involve or affect more than one Faculty or unit; are part of a proposal for a new program; are likely to have a financial impact; represent a definite departure from current policy; involve a quota; articulate a new academic concept\" (3.A.ii). Further, “ASC provides advice or recommends to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) on proposals which involve substantial change to admission/transfer regulations or academic standing.\" (3.B.iv) 7. GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) Terms of Reference (Mandate/Establishment/Termination of Academic Programs): “NOTE: APC deals with major program matters; minor program matters are dealt with through the GFC-mandated course/program approval process. The Provost and Vice-President (Academic) decides what is major or minor. a. To approve the establishment of new academic programs at the University of Alberta or those administered in cooperation with other post-secondary institutions.” (3.8.) Attachment 1.

            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) The combined MScPT/PhD program brings together two programs to achieve efficiencies that help exceptional students seamlessly complete combined clinical and research studies. Two options for flow of the program are proposed – start in the PhD or start in the MScPT. The Impact of the Proposal is The physical therapy profession continues to lack PhD trained clinician-\nscientists to carry out clinically relevant research to advance the profession. Such individuals are essential for the profession to explore new and effective interventions for our clients, and maintain the quality of training for new clinicians at the universities. The implementation of the MScPT Entry-level Program in 2003 has further diminished the number of physical therapists entering research, partly because of the very long time frame of education (i.e., 4 years of undergraduate studies, 2.5 years PT professional training, 4-5 years of PhD training). We will address this issue by implementing an MScPT/PhD combined training program, in an effort to make it more attractive for highly promising individuals partly by reducing the total number of years required for such a qualification. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) n/a Timeline/Implementation Date Effective immediately upon final approval Estimated Cost and funding source There are no resource implications of this program because both programs already exist and are resourced. Students in the program will be assessed doctoral program fees for the entire program. Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) Supplementary Notes and context We expect to enroll a maximum of 2 new students each year. Students in the combined program will be included in the regular MScPT cohort – there will not be additional spots held for combined students. Students in the program will be assessed PhD program fees, which is the same as the fees students enrolled in the MScSLP/PhD program are assessed. Students enrolled in the combined MScPT/PhD program will not have the option of transferring to the MScPT program or the PhD Rehabilitation Sciences program.

In March of 2016 the Board of Governors approved the restructuring of the MNIFs. As part of the MNIFs restructuring, the three parties agreed to the use of an Academic Price Index (API) in the calculation of annual increases to the MNIFs.  The API was designed to reflect inflation drivers within the university versus the Alberta Consumer Price Index (CPI) that was used in the past. Using the agreed to formula, the 2018-19 API for Mandatory Non- Instructional Fees has been calculated at 3.14 per cent (see attached). Pursuant to the agreement with the student associations, this information is being provided to the Board Finance and Property Committee for information. Although the agreed to process allows MNIFs to increase subject to the API, under current government policy, all tuition and fee increases have been held at 0 per cent for the past three years.  Although, the Alberta government committed to releasing the revised tuition fee regulation for 2018-19 fees this fall, at the time of preparing this briefing, the updated regulation was still not available. For 2018-19 MNIFs will increase by the API of 3.14 or be adjusted pursuant to the new tuition fee regulation.

            "Description": "Presenter Steve Dew Provost and Vice-President (Academic) Gitta Kulczycki, Vice-President  (Finance and Administration)   Details Responsibility Steve Dew , Provost and Vice-President (Academic) Gitta Kulczycki, Vice-President  (Finance and Administration) The Purpose of the item is (please be specific) In February of 2016 the university, Students’ Union and Graduate Students’ Association jointly agreed to a restructuring of Mandatory Non-\nInstructional Fees (MNIFs) and a new MNIF Oversight Committee.  In March of 2016 the Board of Governors approved the restructuring of the MNIFs.  As part of the MNIFs restructuring, the three parties agreed to the use of an Academic Price Index (API) in the calculation of annual increases to the MNIFs.  The API was designed to reflect inflation drivers within the university versus the Alberta Consumer Price Index (CPI) that was used in the past.   Using the agreed to formula, the 2018-19 API for Mandatory Non-\nInstructional Fees has been calculated at 3.14 per cent (see attached). Pursuant to the agreement with the student associations, this information is being provided to the Board Finance and Property Committee for information.   Although the agreed to process allows MNIFs to increase subject to the API, under current government policy, all tuition and fee increases have been held at 0 per cent for the past three years.  Although, the Alberta government committed to releasing the revised tuition fee regulation for 2018-19 fees this fall, at the time of preparing this briefing, the updated regulation was still not available.   For 2018-19 MNIFs will increase by the API of 3.14 or be adjusted pursuant to the new tuition fee regulation.
