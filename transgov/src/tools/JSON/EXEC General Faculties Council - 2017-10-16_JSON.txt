The Report of the ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority, endorsed by GFC on April 21, 2017, noted that CLRC currently works within a well defined mandate and the delegated authority given to the committee is also well defined. The benefits to having a Chair with legal training was emphasized in the report and has been added to the proposed terms of reference. No major changes were recommended.

Further changes to the CLRC terms of reference include: 1. Reference to student residence codes has been removed in accordance with the Board’s delegation of creation and revision of these codes to Residence Services (February 2011).  1\n2.

The addition of one elected academic staff member from GFC to the committee composition in accordance with principle 1 of the Principles for Standing Committee Composition: “Wherever possible, the majority of elected members of each standing committee should be drawn from the membership of GFC to provide tangible links between GFC and its standing committees and increase engagement of the greater GFC community.” 4. The voting status of ex-officio members has been revised to reflect their voting status in accordance with principle 3 of the Principles for Standing Committee Composition on GFC. 5. The terms will now note that CLRC makes recommendations to General Faculties Council, rather than to GFC Executive Committee.

The status of these recommendations, as of September 19, 2017, is detailed in Attachment 1, and is summarized as follows:  8 are complete – these are related to principle documents approved by GFC in April 2017  6 are implemented – these include early consultation, GFC meeting frequency, Board relations, and orientation  20 are in-progress – the majority of which are committees working on terms of reference  10 have no action taken to date – of these, 3 relate to Nominating Committee and COSA  4 remain as status quo until other recommendations are implemented ------  Transitioning to a free-standing GFC Nominating Committee: The Nominating Committee should address the following questions:  How will a free-standing Nominating Committee work in the steady state and how will its membership be replenished?  How will the current structure be dismantled to transition to the future steady state? More specifically, how should the current memberships of the overlapping Executive and Nominating Committees be distinguished into two separate committees, and how should the resulting vacancies on each be replenished? ------- Establishment of a working group on COSA: Suggested membership:  Shane Scott, VP Academic SU  Firouz Khodayari, VP Academic GSA Tammy Hopper, representing the Provost member of the Nominating Committee Frank Robinson, former chair COSA The working group should consider the following:  COSA should be reformed to serve a purpose for GFC and deal with GFC related items. Those items that are advisory to the Dean of Students should use a different venue.  A reformed COSA should create an enduring process to enable students to participate in a meaningful forum.  It should have a mandate as a committee of GFC and be supported by University Governance.  It should become part of the governance process and see more items routed to it.  Membership should include both GFC and non-GFC members.
