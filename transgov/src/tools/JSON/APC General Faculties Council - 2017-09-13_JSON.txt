Report of the ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority (April 21, 2017) Orientation and Education “Orientation sessions should provide both high level governance information and detailed information on the responsibilities of members, voting protocol, seating, how meetings are structured, question period procedures, how members can report back to their constituencies, and how to get items on the agenda. It is important to recognize that committee orientation must be designed in light of the fact that those at-large members who do not sit on GFC may require additional attention. The ad hoc committee recommends that  orientation and orientation materials should be provided in a number of modes and formats, including stand-alone orientation workshops, briefings at meetings, and through widely available written and online materials. A GFC member handbook or guidebook would be an ideal reference tool. In light of the unique character of collegial academic governance, GFC members should be encouraged to use orientation sessions to meet and get to know their fellow members and create networks which can provide informal support and community building opportunities. The following recommendations focus on improving orientation to prepare GFC and committee members to be informed and active participants in academic governance. Recommendation: THAT a variety of orientation sessions be offered including a general orientation to governance (Governance 101), followed by orientations more specific to GFC and GFC standing committees, and follow up sessions through the year Recommendation: THAT the responsibilities of members be clearly outlined in a core GFC document” Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1.

Strategy: Develop and implement an undergraduate and graduate recruitment and retention strategy to attract Indigenous students from across Alberta and Canada. Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs Section 26(1)).  2. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)).  3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by  individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.)  The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar.  The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.”  4. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure:  “PROCEDURE   1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS  Following approval by GFC:  a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar).  For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006).”  b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the  approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.”  5. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference (Mandate): “B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, Term Work, Examinations, International Baccalaureate (IB), Advanced Placement (AP)  i. All proposals from the Faculties or the Administration related to admission and transfer, to the academic standing of students, to institutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures and to term work policies and procedures are submitted to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) (or delegate) who chairs the GFC  Academic Standards Committee. ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these proposals.  ii. ASC acts for GFC in approving routine and/or editorial changes to both admission/transfer policies […] iv. ASC provides advice or recommends to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) on proposals which involve substantial change to admission/transfer regulations or to academic standing regulations. 6. GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) Terms of Reference (Mandate): Admission, Transfer and Academic Standing  a. To consider advice or recommendation from the GFC ASC on proposals for the establishment of or change to general University admission or transfer policies affecting students, including policies affecting Open Studies students, and to act for GFC in approving policies which in APC's view are minor or routine; and to recommend to GFC on proposals involving major change  b. To consider advice or recommendation from the GFC ASC on proposals which involve substantial change to admission/transfer regulations or to academic standing regulations. 7.  GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference: Agendas of General Faculties Council GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a GFC agenda, and the order in which those agenda items appear on each GFC agenda. When ordering items, the GFC Executive Committee will be mindful of any matters that are of particular concern to students during March and April so that the student leaders who bring those items forward are able to address these items at GFC before their terms end. When recommendations are forwarded to General Faculties Council from APC, the role of the Executive shall be to decide the order in which items should be considered by GFC. The  Executive Committee is responsible for providing general advice to the Chair about proposals being forwarded from APC to GFC. 1.

            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) To change the name of the Faculty of FPER to a name that more accurately depicts its academic mission and offerings, in support of attracting the best and brightest students and faculty, and being recognized as a leader among its peers. Over the past academic year FPER Faculty members, staff, students, alumni and stakeholders were given the opportunity to provide input on a new Faculty name. After a formal process Faculty Council endorsed the name Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation. The Impact of the Proposal is The new Faculty name better defines and describes the teaching, research and service activities of the Faculty. The new name will both define and differentiate the Faculty at the national and international level, thus helping to attract top quality students, faculty and staff. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Current name:  Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation. Timeline/Implementation Date Effective upon approval. Estimated Cost and funding source The estimated cost of name change is approximately $250,000, which includes costs related to signage inside and outside of all Faculty buildings on North and South Campus, the update of all Faculty-named media, marketing and promotional material, and well as a dedicated marketing and communication plan to promote the new name locally, provincially, nationally, and internationally. Funds to support the costs of the name change will come from the Faculty, the Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic), and the Office of the Vice President University Relations. Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) On final approval by GFC, the Marketing and Communication office in the Faculty will complete both a ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ launch of the new Faculty name. The soft launch will immediately begin using the new Faculty name on any item that allows for immediate alteration (i.e. email signatures, newly created Faculty documents, etc.). The soft launch will occur immediately following approval by GFC. The hard launch of the new Faculty name will take place when all of the marketing, media, promotional material and way-finding signage are prepared. Upon hard launch all references to the former Faculty name will be removed, and the former Faculty name will only be used in the historical context.

The unique-in-Canada inclusion of the term ‘sport’ in the faculty name will offer a point of differentiation on the international scene, whereas the replacement of the name Physical Education with Kinesiology aligns the offerings of the Faculty with our domestic competitors. The renaming of the Faculty will address Objective 6 of the Institution Plan, by developing a ‘brand platform’ that will enhance our reputation, image and identity. The renaming of the Faculty aligns the name/brand of the Faculty with its mission and mandate, which is to ‘create and share (sic) the best understandings and applications of physical activity, sport and recreation for the public good’ (Faculty Strategic Plan 2016-2021). Consistent and aligned with the Institutional plan, the renaming of the Faculty positions the Faculty to Recruit and enroll high quality students and increase the number of out-of-province and international students in the Faculty (aligns with Faculty Strategic Plan; Build). Additionally, the proposed name of the Faculty aligns with Engage under the Faculty Strategic Plan, http://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\n which seeks to ‘increase and depend the understanding’ of the Faculty.
