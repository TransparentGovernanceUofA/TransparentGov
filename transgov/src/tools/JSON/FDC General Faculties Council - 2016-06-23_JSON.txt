The building will feature the appropriate amount of amenities or programmable space required to deliver support services for first-year students and foster a sense of community. The project, described in terms of architectural, electrical, mechanical and structural systems, is being presented to show the results of the transitional phase to detailed design from the schematic design submitted to GFC Facilities Development Committee, May 2016.  • Architectural spaces have their quality and character defined with material and finishes refined to improve items such as operational efficiency, aesthetics and acoustic performance. The design refinement of various social and amenity spaces such as the community kitchen, fitness and multi-purpose rooms will continue with focus meetings with relevant stakeholders.  • Sustainable initiatives have been assessed for feasibility and prepared for incorporation into the detailed design.  • Landscape design concepts have been developed to align with long range planning and open space guidelines as well as specific site context issues including operations, safety, circulation, parking and existing planting. The Impact of the Proposal is This project will increase the amount of purpose-built student housing on campus in alignment with the university’s goal of accommodating 25 per cent of students in residence housing and in support of the goal of the University of Alberta to guarantee housing for all first-year students accepted by the university.
