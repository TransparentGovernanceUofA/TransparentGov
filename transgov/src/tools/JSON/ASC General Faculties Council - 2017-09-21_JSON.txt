Timeline/Implementation Date N/A Supplementary Notes and context Engagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) Participation: (parties who have seen the proposal and in what capacity) Those who are actively participating: • GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Alignment/Compliance Alignment with Guiding Documents For the Public Good Objective 21 Encourage continuous improvement in administrative, governance, planning and stewardship systems, procedures, and policies that enable students, faculty, staff, and the institutions as a whole to achieve shared strategic goals. Report of the ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority (April 21, 2017) Orientation and Education “Orientation sessions should provide both high level governance information and detailed information on the responsibilities of members, voting protocol, seating, how meetings are structured, question period procedures, how members can report back to their constituencies, and how to get items on the agenda. It is important to recognize that committee orientation must be designed in light of the fact that those at-large members who do not sit on GFC may require additional attention. The ad hoc committee recommends that orientation and orientation materials should be provided in a number of modes and formats, including stand-alone orientation workshops, briefings at meetings, and through widely available written and online materials. A GFC member handbook or guidebook would be an ideal reference tool. In light of the unique character of collegial academic governance, GFC members should be encouraged to use orientation sessions to meet and get to know their fellow members and create networks which can provide informal support and community building opportunities. The following recommendations focus on improving orientation to prepare GFC and committee members to be informed and active participants in academic governance. Recommendation: THAT a variety of orientation sessions be offered including a general orientation to governance (Governance 101), followed by orientations more specific to GFC and GFC standing committees, and follow up sessions through the year Recommendation: THAT the responsibilities of members be clearly outlined in a core GFC document” Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment of students to take courses.  2.  PSLA “29(1) A faculty council may:  […] (c) provide for the admission of students to the faculty, (d) determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of studies in the faculty […] subject to any conditions or restrictions that are imposed by the general faculties council. 3.  GFC ASC Terms of Reference (Mandate of the Committee) “D. Alberta Transfer Guide i. ASC approves, for inclusion in the Alberta Transfer Guide, courses for transfer credit to the University of Alberta which are offered by non-\nUniversity institutions in Alberta. Approval will be based upon an assessment of course content and level of instructor qualifications.  ii. ASC denies courses for transfer credit to the University of Alberta which are offered by non-University institutions in Alberta.  iii. ASC monitors the entries in the Alberta Transfer Guide relevant to the University of Alberta.  iv. ASC rescinds, if necessary, the entries in the Alberta Transfer Guide relevant to the University of Alberta.”  4.  UAPPOL Transfer Credit Articulation Procedure (Overview and Procedure):  “The University of Alberta will accept for transfer credit the courses recommended by Faculties and approved by ASC for inclusion in the Alberta Transfer guide, to the extent that the courses fit the degree program that the student wishes to enter. Credit for such courses will be considered in a credit-no credit basis only and will not be included in the University grade point average calculation on the University transcript. Faculties may have other requirements…Transfer credit is assessed on an individual course-by-course basis for by a block transfer agreement.” 5. GFC Academic Standards Committee Terms of Reference (Mandate of the Committee) “A. Definitions i. “Routine and/or Editorial […] the term “routine and/or editorial” refers to proposals which do not involve or affect other Faculties or units; do not form part of a proposal for a new program; and which do not involve alteration of an existing quota or establishment of a new quota. Editorial or routine changes include any and all changes to the wording of an admissions or academic standing policy. […]  B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, Term Work, Examinations, International Baccalaureate (IB), Advanced Placement (AP) i. All proposals from the Faculties or the Administration related to admission and transfer, to the academic standing of students, to institutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures and to term work policies and procedures are submitted to the Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) (or delegate) who chairs the GFC Academic Standards Committee. ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these proposals. ii. ASC acts for GFC in approving routine and/or editorial changes to both admission/transfer policies and academic standing regulations” 3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 4.  UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006).” b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.” 5.  PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). 6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  “All current academic standing regulations, including academic standing categories, University graduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be those prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the University Calendar.” 7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All proposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing academic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the Administration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties will also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any proposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to academic standing, including promotion and graduation. If the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to be in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate University governance process(es). In considering these proposals, governance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices. Normally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or its delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” Attachments  1.
