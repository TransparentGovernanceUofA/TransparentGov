The Impact of the Proposal is To provide CCA students with the opportunity to specialize in HRM by taking HR courses in the Business Administration diploma program at NAIT in the second year of their UAlberta TAA diploma program. Students already have the option of specializing in Marketing, Finance, Accounting and Management by taking second-year specialization courses at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT). Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) N/A Timeline/Implementation Date Effective upon approval Estimated Cost and funding source The courses required to specialize in HRM specialization will be offered in English at NAIT. Students will obtain transfer credit to complete their program requirements for the UAlberta TAA diploma program.  There is therefore no financial impact. Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) This proposal requires approval by the Ministry of Innovation and Advanced Education (IAE).  Supplementary Notes and context The TAA diploma program was approved by the Board of Governors June 17, 2011. The TAA Courses were circulated in accordance with GFC Policy Section 37 in May 2015. The TAARH Designator was approved at the January 11, 2016 GFC Executive Meeting. Appendix 2 as indicated throughout the program proposal refers to the approved TAA program which was approved by APC on April 27, 2011.
