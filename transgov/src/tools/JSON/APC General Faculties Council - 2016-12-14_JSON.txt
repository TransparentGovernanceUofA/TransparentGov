            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) The proposed 15-credit free-standing University Certificate in Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs (TSCCN) is a certificate program aimed at practicing teachers, learning coaches, and related professionals with a Bachelor’s degree who work on multi-disciplinary teams to support the participation and learning of students with complex communication needs (CCN). TSCCN provides educators with the knowledge and skills required to effectively support students’ ongoing growth in communication, language, literacy, and numeracy. The Impact of the Proposal is Students with CCN require specialized supports to promote successful participation and learning as they work to access the general education curriculum and to achieve general education standards and their individualized learning goals. Most educators currently teaching students with CCN lack the necessary training and experience to use specialized supports effectively and to successfully teach students with CCN. TSCCN provides then with the necessary training.

The proposal is already shared with Alberta Education, Alberta Teachers Association, School Superintendents, and Regional Collaborative Service Delivery (RCSD) centres who are responsible for services.
