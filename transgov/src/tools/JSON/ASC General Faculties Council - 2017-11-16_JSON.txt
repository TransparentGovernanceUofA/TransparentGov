For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006).” b.

The proposal will provide additional clarity around the academic and non-academic admission requirements for the MD Program. In 2016 the ASC approved changes to MD Program admission to require a baccalaureate degree for entry, and many of the wording updates in this proposal will align with this previously approved Calendar change.  The addition of an item within both the academic and non-academic requirements section termed ‘additional assessments’ is meant to allow the program to introduce additional tools to enhance the screening of applicants by use of various non-cognitive assessment tools, as well as allow the admissions committee the option to utilize different assessment tools during each admission cycle.  Amendment of the term ‘sex’ to ‘gender’ to ensure the use of inclusive language.  Update contact role for Aboriginal Applicants from previous “Coordinator, Aboriginal Health Care Careers” to “Administrator, Indigenous Health Initiatives Program” The Impact of the Proposal is  The impact of this proposal will be that the wording in the MD Program admission section will be updated to provide a clearer outline for prospective applicants.

The median will then be determined by the applicant pool. This change was added at the recommendation of Michele Moroz, Assistant Registrar.  - The removal of wording around the number of required credits to meet criteria of a full course load is being removed to ensure inclusion of students holding a full course load while being accommodated in any way.  - The purpose of adding the Academic Standing state of “Unsatisfactory Standing” is to allow for instances of a repeat year in specific circumstances. This aligns with other Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry professional programs that allow a repeat year.  - The purpose of changing the final decision maker regarding reexaminations from the Program Director to the RADTH Academic Standings Committee is to ensure that decisions such as this are vetted by a larger group rather than the discretion of one person. This change was also a recommendation from the program’s accreditation process, which was completed in 2016. - The removal of specific clinical site listings is to allow the program to grow and expand without need for specific changes to the sites listed.

To excel and achieve our full potential as an institution and as individuals, the University of Alberta will sustain a learning and research culture that inspires, supports, and champions high professional standards and outstanding achievements in basic and applied research and scholarship, creative activity, administration, and governance. Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment (Section 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic Standards Committee (ASC). 2. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). 3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 4. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.” 5. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). 6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy: All current academic standing regulations, including academic standing categories, University graduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be those prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the University Calendar. 7. GFC Academic Standards Committee  Terms of Reference (3. Mandate): “A. Definitions i. Routine and/or Editorial […] the term “routine and/or editorial” refers to proposals which do not involve or affect other Faculties or units; do not form part of a proposal for a new program; and which do not involve alternation of an existing quota or establishment of a new quota. Editorial or routine changes include any and all change to the wording or an admissions or academic standing policy.” “B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, Term Work, Examinations, […] i. All proposals from the Faculties or the Administration related to admission and transfer, to the academic standing of students, to institutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures and to term work policies and procedures are submitted to the Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) (or delegate) who chairs the GFC Academic Standards Committee. ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these proposals. ii. ASC acts for GFC in approving routine and/or editorial changes to both admission/transfer policies and academic standing regulations” Attachments: 1.
