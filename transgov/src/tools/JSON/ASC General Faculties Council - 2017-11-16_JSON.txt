The median will then be determined by the applicant pool. This change was added at the recommendation of Michele Moroz, Assistant Registrar.  - The removal of wording around the number of required credits to meet criteria of a full course load is being removed to ensure inclusion of students holding a full course load while being accommodated in any way.  - The purpose of adding the Academic Standing state of “Unsatisfactory Standing” is to allow for instances of a repeat year in specific circumstances. This aligns with other Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry professional programs that allow a repeat year.  - The purpose of changing the final decision maker regarding reexaminations from the Program Director to the RADTH Academic Standings Committee is to ensure that decisions such as this are vetted by a larger group rather than the discretion of one person. This change was also a recommendation from the program’s accreditation process, which was completed in 2016. - The removal of specific clinical site listings is to allow the program to grow and expand without need for specific changes to the sites listed.

UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.” 5.
