            "Agenda Title": "Renewal of the Undergraduate Nursing Curriculum, Faculty of Nursing Item Proposed by Greta Cummings, Dean, Faculty of Nursing Presenter Greta Cummings, Dean; Olive Yonge, Vice-Dean; Sandra Davidson, Associate Dean (Undergraduate Programs), Faculty of Nursing Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the item is (please be specific) To discuss the curriculum renewal project which used a Development Evaluation framework and the resulting changes to the undergraduate nursing program. The proposal for substantive changes to the Undergraduate Nursing Curriculum was considered and approved by the GFC Academic Planning Committee, with delegated authority from GFC, on October 25, 2017. Final approved documents The proposal was also considered by the GFC Academic Standards Committee with respect to admission/transfer and academic standing, and the GFC Committee on the Learning Environment with respect to promoting an optimal learning environment. Timeline/Implementation Date Fall 2018 Supplementary Notes and context The program changes will allow the Faculty of Nursing to deliver an enhanced undergraduate experience to our students.  Specific enhancements that will benefit students include: o Programs are constructed using concept-based teaching & learning approaches, learner-centered education principles, relationship-centered care and intentional clinical learning experiences (deliberate practice) o Major enhancements in amount and type of leadership courses (increasing from 1 leadership course to 4 courses), including a 9 credit senior clinical leadership practicum in the 4th year o Specific focus on developing stress management and resiliency through the integration of formal evidence-based Mindfulness- Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) components and strategies for student success o Clearer and closer connections between classroom, lab and clinical learning experiences (conceptually and timing of experiences) – based on evidence and best practices o Integration of a Community Service Learning course early in the program, and other opportunities to engage in clinical experiences earlier in the programs (starting in 1st semester) o Purposeful integration of healthcare informatics and technology that reflects current and emerging practice in healthcare o Inter-professional learning experiences embedded throughout the program in addition to a leadership course focused on the application of Inter-professional healthcare competencies o Integration of the Indigenous Health in Canada course – in http://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/AcademicPlanningCommittee/APCMotionandFinalDocumentSummary/%7E/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/ACP/17-18/OC-25/Final-Motion-and-Document-Summary.pdf response to the TRC recommendations for health disciplines o Academic standing and admissions policies include a minimum pass (C+) standard for key foundational courses that will ensure students have the knowledge necessary for success in higher level clinical courses o Additional and enhanced clinical experiences (increased hours of clinical practice) as well as the use of a wider range of practice settings that more accurately reflect the current and future practice settings of Registered Nurses o Purposeful engagement with and integration of the programs of research of our faculty members ~ leveraging our strength as a top ranked research Faculty to enhance our undergraduate student experience Starting Fall of 2018, the Undergraduate Nursing Programs will offer the new courses and a new course sequence for all incoming students. Because of the significant enhancements and clear student benefits, we have created a proposed cross-walk plan for students who entered our programs in the Fall of 2017 to move into year two of the new programs in the Fall of 2018 so that they can also have the benefits of the program changes for the remainder of their undergraduate education.

            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) To allow the Alberta School of Business to waive the English Language Proficiency (ELP) requirement which will enable them to offer a degree where the language of instruction is in Mandarin without determining the English Language Proficiency of the applicants. The Impact of the Proposal is The benefits of Mandarin delivery of the MFM and MBA programs in China would create the following benefits to the School and the University: • Enhanced global reach and branding of the School; • Greater effectiveness in attracting quality international students; • Enhanced learning experience for students in their native language; • Internationalization of School culture and student experience; • Internationalization and expansion of alumni network; and • Increased potential for external development. Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) n/a Timeline/Implementation Date Effective upon final approval and for publication in the 2018-2019 Calendar. If approved, the waiving of the ELP requirement would apply to applicants to the MFM (in Mandarin) and the MBA (in Mandarin) for 2018 admission. Estimated Cost and funding source n/a Next Steps (ie.: Communications Plan, Implementation plans) Supplementary Notes and context In 2014 the Alberta School of Business started offering a Master of Financial Management (MFM) degree in Shenzhen, China.  This degree is offered in partnership with Xi’an Jiaotong University (XJTU) and the Research Institute of Tsinghua University) and is taught in English.  The partnership agreement between UA and XJTU contemplated that the degree could be offered in Mandarin in the future.   Given the success of our program in Shenzhen, we want to expand the MFM degree to Shanghai and offer an MBA degree in Shenzhen.  Both of the programs will be delivered in Mandarin.  Instructors from our partner universities (XJTU and Tsinghua) will be utilized for part of the instruction with simultaneous translation being used for courses taught by our English-speaking instructors. Program standards conform with our existing degrees as well as the Government of Alberta guidelines for Off-Shore Program Delivery.  In addition, as the first and longest continuously AACSB accredited business school in Canada this program will be subject to external review as well as our internal Quality Assurance processes mandated by CAQC.   ----  The GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) decided not to act with its delegated authority on this item, and forwards it to General Faculties Council with a recommendation for GFC to approve the proposal. During its discussion, ASC noted that it is prudent that GFC consider the following: - the context of the proposal – the waiver is specific to graduate programs in the Alberta School of Business, and only when these programs are approved to be offered in a language other than English - proficiency in the language of instruction is required - that this proposal is for delivery in a country where the local language of instruction is not English - the proposal, which ASC supports, could set a precedent for waiving ELP when delivering programs in international contexts  Engagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) Participation: (parties who have seen the proposal and in what capacity) <For further information see the link posted on the Governance Toolkit section Student Participation Protocol> Those who have been informed: Those who have been consulted: • Steven Dew, Provost and Vice-President (Academic) • Heather Zwicker, Dean FGSR • Amy Dambrowitz, Assistant Dean (Administration) FGSR  • Thomas Hidson, Assistant Registrar (Records), Office of the Registrar has confirmed that the transcript can designate that the language of instruction is in Mandarin.  • Danielle Scott, Assistant Director (International Relations) UAI has reviewed the agreements between UA and our international partner institutions and provided feedback to ensure compliance with existing UA policy standards. http://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nThose who are actively participating: • Michael Maier, Associate Dean, Master’s Programs, Alberta School of Business (ASOB) • Edy Wong, Associate Dean/International, ASOB • Stefanie Claro, International Partnerships Coordinator, ASOB • Chris Lynch, Senior Director, Recruitment, Admissions & Marketing, Master's Programs, ASOB • Janice Hurlburt, Governance and Policy Coordinator FGSR • Deborah Burshtyn, Vice-Dean FGSR • Tammy Hopper, Vice-Provost (Programs), Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) confirmed on July 5, 2017 that the Provost has approved the offering of the program in a language other than English and that the language of instruction may be identified on the transcript. • Kate Peters, Portfolio Initiatives Manager, Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) Approval Route (Governance) (including meeting dates) Alberta School of Business Graduate Students Policy Committee -- August 17, 2017 Alberta School of Business Faculty Council -- September 1, 2017 FGSR Council – September 13, 2017 GFC ASC Subcommittee on Standards – October 5, 2017 GFC Academic Standards Committee – October 19, 2017 GFC Executive Committee – November 20, 2017 General Faculties Council – November 27, 2017 Final Approver General Faculties Council Alignment/Compliance Alignment with Guiding Documents Institutional Strategic Plan - For the Public Good BUILD GOAL: Build a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty and staff from Alberta, Canada, and the world.

Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment (Section 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has delegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic Standards Committee (ASC). 2. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). 3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 2. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.” 3. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference  “3 B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, Term Work, Examinations, International Baccalaureate (IB), Advanced Placement (AP) i. All proposals from the Faculties or the Administration related to admission and transfer, to the academic standing of students, to institutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures and to term work policies and procedures are submitted to the Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) (or delegate) who chairs the GFC Academic Standards Committee. ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these proposals.  ii. ASC acts for GFC in approving routine and/or editorial changes to both admission/transfer policies and academic standing regulations…” 4. GFC Executive Committee “GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a GFC agenda, and the order in which those agenda items appear on each GFC agenda. When ordering items, the GFC Executive Committee will be mindful of any matters that are of particular concern to students during March and April so that the student leaders who bring those items forward are able to address these items at GFC before their terms end. […] the role of the Executive Committee shall be to examine and debate the substance of reports or recommendations and decide if an item is ready to be forwarded to the full governing body. The Executive Committee may decide to refer a proposal back to the originating body, to refer the proposal to another body or individual for study or review, or to take other action in order to ready a proposal for consideration by General Faculties Council. “ Attachments (each to be numbered 1 - 2) 1.
