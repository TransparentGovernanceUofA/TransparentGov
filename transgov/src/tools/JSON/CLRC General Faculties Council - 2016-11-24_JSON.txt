            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) To add ENGG 404 to the list of courses for which consolidated final exams are scheduled. The Impact of the Proposal is Current state: ENGG 404 is a course offered by the faculty of Engineering. Until 2016, this course was mandatory for students enrolled in Mining Engineering and Petroleum Engineering, while it was an approved program elective for many other programs. This course has been traditionally offered only in the Fall term and is well received by the students. In the past few years, two sections have been offered. The course has multiple evaluation methods: mid-terms, final exams and a small project. Future state: Starting 2016, all students admitted into specialized engineering programs are required to take ENGG 404. This is part of the faculty’s commitment towards educating future engineers on this very important topic. The specific terms in which each ENGG 404 is scheduled varies from one program to another. Accordingly, at steady-state, ENGG 404 will be offered in all three terms in order to accommodate all students in engineering. Based on current statistics, the projected enrollment for ENGG 404 is provided in the table below. Year AY 2016-2017 AY 2017-\n2018 AY 2018-2019 AY 2019-2020 Term F W S-S F W S-\nS F W S-S F W S-S Projected enrollment 250 - - 300 - - 570 250 130 700 320 125 Rationale for requesting consolidated exams: As it can be seen from the above table multiple sections become necessary to accommodate the growing numbers. For example, at steady state, we expect 700 students to be enrolled in the Fall term translating into ≈5 to 6 sections. In order to ensure consistency in the exams, a consolidated mid-term and final exam seems necessary. We are currently working with the Faculty student services to schedule consolidated mid-terms and would like to request GFC’s approval of consolidated final exams for all terms (Fall, Winter and Spr/Sum) starting from Fall 2017.
