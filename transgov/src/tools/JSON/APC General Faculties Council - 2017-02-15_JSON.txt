The Impact of the Proposal is The proposed Policy indicates that, “The University recognizes the harm caused by a culture in which common attitudes, norms and practices tolerate, normalize, trivialize, excuse or outright condone sexual violence.” The Sexual Violence Policy suite affirms the University’s commitment to support survivors of sexual violence in a survivor driven process.  The Policy suite includes key definitions to educate all members of the university community.   Fundamental principles established in the policy suite include the importance of believing survivors when they disclose an experience of sexual violence and providing support, accommodations, interim measures, and information on filing a formal complaint.  In addition, the proposed policy indicates “The University takes seriously its responsibility to reduce sexual violence by fostering a culture of consent and support through education, training and policy.”  The impact will be an increasingly educated and informed community that can better handle disclosures and complaints of sexual violence. The Government of Alberta has made it clear that they expect every institution to produce a stand-alone policy on sexual violence.

Four working groups have been formed to manage the implementation of the policy and procedure.  Those four working groups include: Support, Assessment, Education and Outreach, and Accountability.  In addition to ensuring that the policy and procedure are implemented, the working groups will enhance the University’s communication of the policy suite.
