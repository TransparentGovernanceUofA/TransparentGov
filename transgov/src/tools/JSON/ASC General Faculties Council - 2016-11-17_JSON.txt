Compliance with Legislation, Policy and/or Procedure Relevant to the Proposal (please quote legislation and include identifying section numbers) 1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over academic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors authority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting enrolment of students to take courses. The Board has delegated its authority over these areas to GFC. GFC has thus established, and delegated certain powers to, an Academic Standards Committee. 2.  PSLA “29(1) A faculty council may:  […] (c) provide for the admission of students to the faculty, (d) determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of studies in the faculty […] subject to any conditions or restrictions that are imposed by the general faculties council. 3.  GFC ASC Terms of Reference (Mandate of the Committee) “D. Alberta Transfer Guide i. ASC approves, for inclusion in the Alberta Transfer Guide, courses for transfer credit to the University of Alberta which are offered by non-\nUniversity institutions in Alberta. Approval will be based upon an assessment of course content and level of instructor qualifications.  ii. ASC denies courses for transfer credit to the University of Alberta which are offered by non-University institutions in Alberta.  iii. ASC monitors the entries in the Alberta Transfer Guide relevant to the University of Alberta.  iv. ASC rescinds, if necessary, the entries in the Alberta Transfer ASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 4 - page 2\nGuide relevant to the University of Alberta.”  4.  UAPPOL Transfer Credit Articulation Procedure (Overview and Procedure):  “The University of Alberta will accept for transfer credit the courses recommended by Faculties and approved by ASC for inclusion in the Alberta Transfer guide, to the extent that the courses fit the degree program that the student wishes to enter. Credit for such courses will be considered in a credit-no credit basis only and will not be included in the University grade point average calculation on the University transcript. Faculties may have other requirements…Transfer credit is assessed on an individual course-by-course basis for by a block transfer agreement.” 5. GFC Academic Standards Committee Terms of Reference (Mandate of the Committee) “A. Definitions i. “Routine and/or Editorial […] the term “routine and/or editorial” refers to proposals which do not involve or affect other Faculties or units; do not form part of a proposal for a new program; and which do not involve alteration of an existing quota or establishment of a new quota. Editorial or routine changes include any and all changes to the wording of an admissions or academic standing policy. […]  B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, Term Work, Examinations, International Baccalaureate (IB), Advanced Placement (AP) i. All proposals from the Faculties or the Administration related to admission and transfer, to the academic standing of students, to institutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures and to term work policies and procedures are submitted to the Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) (or delegate) who chairs the GFC Academic Standards Committee. ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these proposals. ii. ASC acts for GFC in approving routine and/or editorial changes to both admission/transfer policies and academic standing regulations” 3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota ASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 4 - page 3\nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 4.  UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006).” b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.” 5.  PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). 6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  “All current academic standing regulations, including academic standing categories, University graduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be those prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the University Calendar.” 7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All proposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing academic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the Administration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties will also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any proposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to academic standing, including promotion and graduation. If the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to be in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate University governance process(es). In considering these proposals, governance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with other individuals and offices. ASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 4 - page 4\nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or its delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” Attachments  1.

EGA: with the addition of courses from available minors, the calculation of EGA was changed to exclude courses that were not mandated as part of an engineering program. This is proposed to ensure that additional courses (such as those from minors) did not favorably or unfavorably affect graduating average.  This further ensures fairness between students taking minors or not, as well as students taking approved extra to degree courses. This is in line with the traditional definition of EGA and is critical as part of engineering program accreditation. 2. Distinction: The proposed change in the definition of Distinction is in response again to the new proposed minors. However, the new definition is more inclusive than the previous definition. The members Faculty of Engineering’s APC and ECC believe that any student that graduates with an EGA of 3.5 or above is meritorious of the awarding of distinction. The Impact of the Proposal is 1. Maintain the traditional calculation of EGA in response to the new program options available to engineering students and ensure accreditation. 2. Ensure that all meritorious students, with EGA of 3.5 or above are awarded distinction. There have been cases where students with such EGAs did not receive Distinction because of “lighter loads”; the new calculation of EGA ensures a fairer assessment of students.

As we intend to allow current to undertake minors even if not in their acceptance calendar, students will need to agree to the new EGA calculations and distinction definition.

The Impact of the Proposal is An audit of student transcripts/academic performance for a five-year term showed a growing trend of students who are required to withdraw or failing 3rd and 4th year clinical courses. These students have a pattern of low grades in the foundation courses (e.g. Anatomy & Physiology, Pathophysiology, Microbiology). That means they have had D, D+ or C's in often more than one of the foundation courses.  We have also completed an environmental scan (review of progression policies/calendar statements) of other comparable BSN programs in Canada and the US, and have determined that the majority of nursing programs do indeed have a higher \"minimum pass\" standard for their programs (higher than the standard University-wide grading scale). The range for such a minimum pass was 70-76% and some programs used this for only selected courses, while other programs required this higher bar for all courses in the nursing program.  Our decision to institute this foundation course minimum pass was based on data and best practice and the intent is to support students and ensure that they have the strong foundational knowledge required to be successful in the higher level nursing courses, and prevent them from falling out of sequence and repeating clinical courses. Repeating clinical courses is often problematic due to the scarcity of clinical placements and this may require students to wait until a placement becomes available, and thus increase the length of their program.

UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented academic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” 2. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: “PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective after the change has been published in the University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). b. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the approving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of implementation will be effective immediately or at the next available intake for the admitting Faculty.” 5.

            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) The proposed 15-credit free-standing University Certificate in Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs (TSCCN) is a certificate program aimed at practicing teachers, learning coaches, and related professionals with a Bachelor’s degree who work on multi-disciplinary teams to support the participation and learning of students with complex communication needs (CCN). TSCCN provides educators with the knowledge and skills required to effectively support students’ ongoing growth in communication, language, literacy, and numeracy. The Impact of the Proposal is Students with CCN require specialized supports to promote successful participation and learning as they work to access the general education curriculum and to achieve general education standards and their individualized learning goals. Most educators currently teaching students with CCN lack the necessary training and experience to use specialized supports effectively and to successfully teach students with CCN. TSCCN provides then with the necessary training.
