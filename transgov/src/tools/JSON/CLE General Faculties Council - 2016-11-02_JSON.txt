GFC policy 111 Teaching and Learning and Teaching Evaluation “111.2 Teaching Evaluation  1. Evaluation of teaching at the University of Alberta serves two purposes: a. Summative – Evaluation provides a review and overview of an instructor’s teaching that is an essential element in promotion and tenure decisions. In its summative form, teaching evaluation forms a basis for rewarding excellence, as well as the basis for withholding reward. b. Formative – Evaluation provides helpful feedback to teachers by identifying teaching strengths and weaknesses and, in so doing, giving guidance for the improvement or refinement of teaching skills. 2. Evaluation of teaching must be multifaceted. Multifaceted evaluation shall include the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction set out in Section 111.3 and other methods of assessing teaching designed within individual Faculties to respond to the particular conditions of that Faculty. Such assessments shall include one or more of the following: input from administrators, peers, self, undergraduate and graduate students, and alumni. 3. Recognizing that the evaluation of teaching at the University shall be multifaceted, Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) decisions concerning tenure, promotion or unsatisfactory teaching performance must be based on more than one indicator of the adequacy of teaching. 4. Assessment of teaching involving input from administrators, peers, self, alumni, or undergraduate and graduate students in addition to the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction should occur annually prior to tenure. For continuing faculty (ie, Categories A1.1, A1.5 and A1.6), such assessment will occur at least triennially.  5. The University shall continue to support University Teaching Services in its education programming which is focused on the development and improvement of teaching and learning and its efforts to enhance research in university teaching. 111.3 Universal Student Ratings of Instruction In recognition of the University's commitment to teaching, the General Faculties Council endorses a system of Universal Student Ratings of Instruction. This system, however, is only one part of the multi-faceted approach described in Section 111.2. The Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are administered electronically via a system known as the eUSRI system.   The Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are designed to provide a minimal university-wide base of information on student ratings to the parties listed in this Section. With this purpose in mind, the General Faculties Council adopts the following policies: A. All Faculties will ensure that evaluation of all instructors and courses will take place each time a course is offered. The term ‘instructors’ is meant to include tenured professors, tenure-track professors, sessional instructors, clinical instructors, field supervisors and graduate teaching assistants with responsibilities for courses. […] D. The anonymity of student responses to the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction is of fundamental importance in maintaining student confidentiality and encouraging the free expression of views. Under normal circumstances, the anonymity of students will be protected. Universal Student Ratings of Instruction offer an avenue of feedback, including feedback critical of instructors. […] G. The numerical summaries for the ten Universal Student Ratings of Instruction questions will be reported to the instructor, the Chair, Director or Dean and students. […] I. All results given out to students, Chairs, Directors and Deans will have the following cautionary preface: Student questionnaires form an important part of evaluating teaching effectiveness but cannot be taken alone as a complete assessment of an instructor or course. Factors other than an instructor’s teaching ability may influence ratings. These factors include class size, class level, Faculty, time in class, required versus optional course, grade expectations, student GPA, gender, race, ethnicity, age of both students and instructors. […] J. Nothing in this section will prevent instructors from seeking other means of feedback from students during the term.” The full GFC Policy 111 Teaching and Learning and Teaching Evaluation is available at: http://www.gfcpolicymanual.ualberta.ca/111TeachingandLearningan\ndTeach.aspx 5. University of Alberta Faculty Agreement July 2006 (incorporating June 2007 and July 2008 amendments) “13.06 The standards for evaluation of teaching performance shall be broadly based, including course content, course design and performance in the classroom. Such evaluation may take into account information such as statistical summaries of responses to student questionnaires, comprehensive reviews of student commentary; reviews by peers, reviews by administrative officials and reviews of teaching dossiers and other materials provided by the staff member.” Attachments  1.
